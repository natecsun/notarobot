"I don't know where I am." Molly groaned and rubbed her eyes, staring up at the ceiling, "But this bed is soooooo comfortable."<br>
"It'll be a while before you become adjusted." said a voice thick with emotion, from the corner. Molly sat straight up. She had thought she was talking to herself. In her just-waken daze she could barely make out a non-descript mass of pink fur sitting on a bureau. Very nice bureau, she thought. Copycat baroque period. Must be worth some money.
<br><br>
"And you are...?"<br><br>

The pink mass opened up to reveal rows upon rows of pointy teeth, attempting, it would seem, a smile of some sort.<br><br>

"I am Armando, the Rose of P-Got County. You are my guest. You mustn't be frightened of me, my child." <br>
"I'm not frightened." said Molly. "I only grimaced because I think I'm getting cramps." <br>
"Do you want to know how you got here?" <br>
"I suppose so," said Molly in a lazy voice, "but only if it's related in some way to me going home." <br>
"Emm..." said the pink thing apologetically, "never mind then."<br><br>

An uncomfortable silence pervaded the room. A few moments passed, then Molly said, "I like your bed. It's very comfortable." <br>
"Yes, I notice you haven't gotten out of it yet." <br>
"Well, it's nice. Very comfortable." <br>
"You said that already." <br>
More silence.<br><br>

"You're not much like the other girls we capture." <br>
"Oh, am I captured?" said Molly in surprise. "Well, you're treating me very well." "Of course! No one should ever say that Armando the Rose of P-Got County was not an excellent host." Armando frowned, his rows of teeth making a sharp crescent moon. "On a more serious note, however, I don't understand why you're not more afraid." <br>
"Well, didn't you tell me not to be?"<br> 
"Well. Yes. I did. But..." Armando shifted uncomfortably. "That's just something I say. Part of the routine, you know?" <br>
"It was very believable. I trusted your statement completely." <br>
"Err...good."<br><br>

Armando looked around the room, searching for words. <br>
"So. Do you want to know where you are?" <br>
"Well, I guess it doesn't really matter, does it?" <br>
"What do you mean?" asked Armando. <br>
"I mean," said Molly, fanning her gown, "that I won't be leaving this place, as far as I can tell, and so that, wherever I am, I'm stuck here. So it's just better, in general, not to really get overly concerned about it. There being nothing I can do." <br>
"Aren't you going to try to get home?"<br>
"If I'm going to fail, what's the point?" <br>
"Oh. I see." Armando said, hopefully. "You're waiting for someone to rescue you." <br>
"I doubt it. Who'll come here, after me? I don't have a boyfriend." <br>
"Maybe a prince, who's in love with you!" said Armando, eagerly. <br>
"He's have to be the Prince of Nashua, New Hampshire, because I've never been anywhere else."<br><br>

"Oh." Armando pretended to be very interested in his toenails, which didn't exist. A few moments later, he looked up, embarrassed. <br>
"You don't happen to be a Ninja, do you?" <br>
"God, no!" Molly laughed. "I'm a smoker."<br>
"Oh." Armando was disappointed. "You're not of royal lineage I presume?" <br>
"No, my dad is a banker." said Molly. "And not a very good one, at that. My family hasn't moved into the upper middle class bracket quite yet."<br><br>

"Maybe you aren't scared because you are under a spell," said Armando, "and I'm the only one who can help you! Maybe we'll fall passionately in love, and our kiss of true love will save both of our souls!" <br>
"Get real!" sneered Molly. "You look like a ball of cotton candy with teeth. And I'm diabetic. If you get my drift." <br>
"Aren't you just a little bit afraid?" <br>
"Of what? Torture?" <br>
"No, we don't really torture our girls." <br>
"Well, there you go, then."<br><br>

Armando tried switching tactics. <br>
"We could use you for breeding purposes!" <br>
"I don't think so. Genetically it would be impossible." Molly sighed. "This really is a comfortable bed. My bed back home is the land of lumpy." <br>
"Are you really brave? Full of vim and vigor? A courageous heroine looking for revenge? Maybe?" <br>
"Sorry, Armando. All I am right now is very, very bored." <br>
"I'm deeply disappointed to hear that." said Armando, as he pulled a gun from under his fluff. "But you are of no use to this story. Something has to happen, and you don't seem very excited to either scream or cry or try to escape." <br>
"Ah," thought Molly. "Finally, something interesting."<br> 
Her brains hit the wall, and Armando sunk into a deep, if mediocre, depression.

Three:<br><br>	

In the west, whatever that means in this land, is a forest of immeasurable depth and phosphorescent foliage, it's trees bearing the most delectable and bitter of fruits, the most pompous and humble of flowers. The forest provides habitat to no beast, neither vicious, gentle, comical, nor fearsome, though it is said that perhaps there were once many creatures there who were merely drawn to the sky long ago to investigate its intentions. When the wind blows, the trees become giddy with excitement and may display their delight by emitting deep-blue beams of light from the ends of their branches. The great explorer Auraleus Branson first traveled to this land in search of a supposed treasure which its forest held, though the only clue he had obtained regarding the treasure's whereabouts was, "it will surround you." At first, Auraleus had thought that the treasure might have something to do with the multi-colored flows pumping through wiry veins in the trees' interiors, a swirl of pastels made visible through transparent bark. He never found out for sure; in addition to being transparent, the bark also proved quite impenetrable. Auraleus never obtained whatever it was he might have seeked in the forest. 
<br><br>
Two:	
<br><br>
In the south, or what Auraleus determined to be south, is a network of seas wherein gravity is so suspended as to leave waves frozen in their place once they have formed, though remaining pliable should some suggestive force push them again into lurching motion. However, suggestive forces were hard to come by in this region, as were any beings with an interest in aquatics. Such a desolation is perhaps natural in a body of liquid which retains the mark of a hand print and leaves tunnels in the wake of any object that passes through. Swimming or otherwise navigating through such an environment is nearly impossible, though Auraleus Branson was willing to give it a shot on his second journey to the land, in which he had been in pursuit of a legendary anchor which was told to have fallen from the only vessel ever to have somehow held its weight upon the engulfing waters. Auraleus could not imagine any vessel that would've been able to perform such a task on such a surface. The idea that this apparent impossibility could ever have been contradicted drove the explorer to risk his life in seeking a remnant of the phantom ship. The first inclination Auraleus had while maneuvering about in his aqua-pod-a vessel specially designed by his team of engineers to defy the properties of this sculptured sea-was to seek out any hollows in the water which reached to the floor. However, such formations were not to be found and Auraleus never encountered the trophy which had been spoken of in so many taverns with hushed tones. Soon afterward, the strength of the legend began to fade. 
<br><br>
One:	
<br><br>
Along the north and east of the land lies one edge of an expansive canyon, the other side of which is visible only with telescopic aid from the vantage point of the field which serves as the heart of the canyon, forest, and seas. It was from this area that Auraleus had made his directional determinations, and it was from this gray grass field that Auraleus had, on his third trip to the land, made an attempt to cross the black sink of the canyon. "Surely," he thought then, "there are spoils to be had on the other side." Previous explorers had tried and failed because the mechanics of their flying vessels always mysteriously malfunctioned after traveling just a few feet over the gap. Auraleus knew that his method should lack machinery, and it occurred to him to use grassblades of varying length in the field to make himself a set of wings. Once the wings were completed, Auraleus-the possesor of a nimble and highly flexible body-stitched them painlessly into his shoulder blades and had his engineers build a catapulting device for setting him airborne. The device ejected him without a hitch, and Auraleus experienced a nervous exhiliration due to the fact that there had been no chance for a test flight of the wings. Luckily, they held him aloft and on course as expected; until, that is, he had traveled several hundred feet over the canyon and a highly intent gust of wind blasted him smoothly and swiftly back in the direction from which he'd come. This event became routine on Auraleus' dozens of subsequent attempts, and after a great period of time he finally gave up crossing the canyon. It had never occurred to Auraleus to simply hitch a ride with one of the clouds that were in perpetual motion along a narrow belt from the sky above the gray grass field, across the canyon, and to the other side and beyond, in spite of the rope-like wisps which dangled lithely from them. 
<br><br>
Ignition:
<br><br>
There are no mirrors in this land, but strewn about the gray grass field are numerous sizable shards of reflective glass from various vessels that in some way met their doom while carelessly surveying the area. It was in such a fractured slice of pod-bay glass that Auraleus, now heavy with the weight of graying hair and sagging skin, observed his hand as he folded it into the shape of a crude photon accelerator and hoped with all of his might that it would become real. He thought of the times that being able to make this happen would've come in handy and chuckled softly as his hand fell limp. Auraleus had just completed his fourth and what he knew to be final mission in this sector, and as he waited patiently for his crew to retrieve him he could do nothing but contemplate what had come upon him in the Castle Made of Rocketships. It rests in the northwest corner of the gray grass field, approximately one mile east of the forest and one mile south of the canyon's edge.
<br><br>
The castle is anchored by five lofty towers positioned such that, as connected by the castle walls, they are the vertices of a vast pentagon; as connected by the five-line network of platforms running from tower-top to tower-top, they are the points on a terrestrial star. The entire body of the castle-it's towers, walls, and platforms-consists of polished, pristine remnants of ancient rocketships which seem to have been cut and formed to fit together like interstellar puzzle pieces. Engines, body fragments, and interior elements are all exposed and somehow coalesced into the shape of a five-sided castle, though no whole rocketship remains intact (nearly so in the towers, however). There seemed to be no outer entrance along any of the walls, and Auraleus' attempts to dig a tunnel to the castle's interior were thwarted: it's foundation ran deeper than he had imagined it could. However, much to his surprise, his surveillance indicated that the top of the castle was uncovered aside from the network of platforms. Auraleus still sported the wings that he had used in his third mission to the land, and the catapult from that same mission remained where he'd left it. Though his wings had slightly withered over time, Auraleus determined that they should still serve him well as they had on many occasions since he attached them, and of course any device constructed by his engineers took many more ages to deteriorate than he could hope to live.
<br><br>
Sure enough, the wings still worked wonderfully, and after initiating the catapult Auraleus glided gently through the sky in a wide vertical arc before finally landing himself in the center of the castle's interior. Auraleus immediately surmised that he was in what might be considered the courtyard of castle, and he also immediately surmised that he was disappointed. There was no sign of the treasure he had heard so many tales of, or any treasure at all. Aside from the one and a half dozen uniformly chiseled shards of machinery that projected from the ground in three rows in a small square of the courtyard to one side, it seemed that the area was little more than a flat, barren five-walled stretch of hard-packed violet dirt, no portion of which would allow itself to be penetrated by any of Auraleus' digging equipment. After some time, and after realizing that he had not planned a way to get out of the castle, Auraleus watched as a rectangular segment of the wall that hadn't looked door-like at all opened up and a vaguely smiling old man with short white hair and sandstone eyes wearing a mild-blue jumpsuit emerged and walked up to him intently. When he was about five feet in front of Auraleus, the man stopped and without looking away from the explorer reached into a knapsack that was strapped to his back and removed a small cube of mesh and metal tubing which he proceeded to unfold. It was a trampoline. He reached again into the knapsack and removed a thin manuscript. Still silent, he walked up to Auraleus, handed him the manuscript, turned around, and walked into the non-door again without looking back. Once it closed, Auraleus had almost forgotten that it ever existed.
<br><br>
The aging explorer could hardly fathom that his expeditions in this land had rewarded him with no spoils, no goods for trade, no trophies. There was the manuscript, but his interest in it was minute at best. Even those who might have reason to find the information therein intriguing probably wouldn't believe it at all. He saw his crew approaching over the horizon to the west and perked up. Aurleus took one last good look at this land, at the forest, at the seas in the distance, at the canyon, at the thin isolated stream of clouds, and finally at the proud, shimmering Castle Made of Rocketships, which almost seemed to mock him. He felt simultaneously inclined to curse the land under his breath and simply shake his head in awe. For the fourth time in his career he would leave this land with empty hands and a heavy heart, though the next time he was on Earth, Auraleus Branson could tell the people that he knew what became of their astronauts upon those rare occasions that they were irretrievably stranded in the void. He didn't know if he would.

The second coming occurred last week. Jesus appeared on a cross in a church in southern Ohio. Everything went pretty much according to plan. People fainted, wept, were healed, etc. Obese ladies in floral prints pushed their hands toward the light. Mothers held up newborn. Jesus looked around.<br><Br>
Eventually, the people grew still, waiting for a word or thought from on high. Jesus was silent a long time. The people waited. Jesus was silent. Eventually, the people began to go home, one by one.<br><Br>

After a few hours, only Jesus and I were left in the still air of the church. He looked like an effeminate Jew with curly dark hair. He asked why I stayed.<br><Br>

"Well," I replied, snapping my bubble gum, "it's nice and cool in here. The only other place that's a reasonable temperature in August is the pool, but then I'd have to wear a swimming suit." It seemed an unimportant thing to be saying to someone who died for my sins.<br><Br>

"Oh." Said Jesus. There was a long pause full of quiet summer breathing sounds.<br><Br>

"So how come you're here?" I queried. I braced my mortal mind for something profound, incomprehensible, enigmatic. Something above my symbolic motives. Everything He did must surely be calculated, symbolic, and noble.<br><Br>

"Oh, I just get a kick out of seeing them get all excited and weepy like that." He said. "I mean, there's not a lot to do in heaven. Of course, I don't do this all the time. Usually I just go bowling or something. But appearing on crosses is kinda fun to do every once in a while. I like the attention, you know?"<br><Br>

"But then why didn't you talk to them? They would've done anything you said. They were listening." I challenged.<br><Br>

"That's just it." Jesus said, staring off into space. "I didn't have anything to say."

<center><table width="55%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="YELLOW"><td><b>the first checkpoint
</b></td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="white"><td>
A new invention, a personal accessory, really, can't live without it, just in time for the holidays ha ha, a headset and goggles contraption, with a set of flippable lenses over the eyepieces, based on that thing at the eye doctors, where they flip the, yeah, and they say tell me which one is clearer, this one or this one, and you say this one, and they say this one or this one, and you say this one, and they say this one or this one about the same, and you say no the first one, and you're staring at the eyechart and it fades in and out of view.

<br><br>
The eye doctor said I could borrow anything I needed whenever, or at least I think I remember him saying that to me at some point, although why would he, because we're not neighbors, and I've only actually been to see him twice so we're not exactly drinking buddies, plus what would you normally borrow from a optometrist, yet here I was, idea firmly in place, breaking in late one night to steal that flippy eye lens thing, there's probably a name for it but who knows what. It was screwed down to the damn floor which complicated matters, but it came up fine, and no one said anything as I walked down the street with this thing under my arm.<br><br>

So that was stage one, the procuring of the hardware as such, and then years of research at the MIT media lab came into play, and furtive discussions with time-travel theoreticians, -ists and -icians of all manner, sort of talking around a topic, coming at it sideways so as to not actually reveal what it was we're actually talking about here. Confused looks, sentences that began with "yeah, but I’m just saying, if you could..."<br><br>

Then basically a lot of tinkering to get the thing working properly. Basement hours. The nuts and bolts of the thing. It took a Macgyver-like ingenuity and the can-do stick-to-it-tiveness of your common backyard ant, but then eventually, a long solo drive out of the city, out into the country, with the thing in the trunk, wrapped tightly and securely and contained in a box marked "donuts" to throw off the casual on-looker.<br><br>

What you do is this. Find something to look at. Not a specific thing as such, but an area. Say an expanse of field on a rolling hillside. A copse. Start small. You fit the headset on properly, there is a strap so it won't fall off due to sudden shock or amazement, and at first you're just looking through regular glass. You want to get your bearings and set your sights properly.<br><br>

Now there are a series of lenses which you can flip down or up, marked in 50-year increments. You can go forwards or backwards. So say I'm looking at a particular copse, everything looks all fine and normal, isn't nature grand, and then I can see what this same particular area looked like 50 years ago, or 100 years ago, or 50 years in the future, and so on. You get a plus or minus 500-year set of brackets.<br><br>

Now. You want to look at places. Things but not people, people have nothing to do with this. You won't see your wife as an ovum. You won't see your son with robotic limbs and a giant brain. You won't relive the future or the past, pivotal civil war battles or the Earth's last humans desperately fending off a race of alien pirates. You are not an active participant in history or the future. You don't have to worry about moving a rock and changing the outcome of the 2072 Olympics. You are still just standing in the same place you have not gone anywhere.

But look at a cemetery, and see how the gravestones will multiply and take over that neighboring yard, and how the stones over time will soften and whither and eventually disappear.

A miserable city block, the ocean used to come up right to where you're standing, there used to be something about the way the sunlight would come up over those mountains each morning, but you'd never guess, the way it is now.

Obvious examples, but illustrative. An application for the government to get its mitts on, to be sure, but we wouldn't let that happen. It's got a self-destruct button before that ever happened, and none of the plans were ever written down anywhere. "All up here," he said, tapping his noggin.<br><br>

I’m a romantic at heart, is what it is. I get sad thinking about things I’ll miss or never see. I wasn't sure if this would help or not, but I had to try it.

Sally closed her eyes and pretended that she was drowning in the intermittent floods of reddish light filling her eye sockets. She realized that there was not much time.<br><br>

She felt a brief sense of guilt and wastefulness as a random memory floated into her consciousness. She had never spent the hundred dollar bill she had placed under the insole of her left shoe out of boredom and paranoia two years earlier.<br><br>

It would please her to believe that the bill would be discovered a thousand years later when a perfect digging machine would find it while pillaging a landfill for scraps of burnable materials to add to the forty million tons of such waste being rocketed to the sun each week to help keep the large ball of gas afire. Soon later, she imagined, her flawlessly embalmed corpse would be retrieved by a perfect dehydration machine and would be drained of any remaining liquids, which would be added to the forty million gallons of such fluid being poured into large craters each hour in an attempt to refill the oceans.<br><br>

Presumably her thousand-year-old skin would be removed and stretched to be stitched neatly into the quilted tarp of forty million skins that would be erected each May to blanket the city from the deadly acidic rains of the springtime. It would be terrifyingly beautiful, Sally imagined, a fleshtone patchwork quilt hovering over the populace below, a populace blissfully unaware of its unavoidable role in the future of its grayish-pink elastic sky.<br><br>

Sally had chosen to die atop the highest structure in the city, which was a blue-gray hotel that had stood upon the same acre of earth for as long as she cared to remember. She had managed to rent a suite on the second highest floor of the building, as paying for a suite on the highest floor was far beyond her means.<br><br>

Unsatisfied with her suite's altitude, she had climbed the structure's fire escape onto the hotel's flat and unobtrusively attractive roof. She now lay on a concrete block atop the hotel, thoroughly pleased with the realization that the arm she waved gently above her face was the highest point of the city. She paid no mind to the drunken bacchanalia she could hear in the highest suites of the hotel, which were now several meters below her. Sally had remarkably sensitive hearing.<br><br>

With the realization that she may well have been the god of the city, she arbitrarily dropped her arm to her side, then quickly straightened it above her, reaching as high as she could manage without disrupting her position on the concrete slab. Her eyes rolling loosely, Sally smiled, and spent another twenty minutes waving her arm in manifestation of her divine power of whimsical alteration of the highest point of the city.<br><br>

Behind her retinas, the light-emitting-diode still blinked. She let herself drown once more in the stuttering red floods. The dry cell supplying her with the 9 volts of electrical tension that she required to carry on her existence had dried out. She was an efficient machine, she thought, though no more or no less so than the millions that were drawing current in the city below. Sally's eyelids fluttered and closed with an inaudible mechanical hum, and she recalled fondly the moment the doctors had severed her soft, fleshy AC cord at her birth.

a conspiracy to keep you underneath warm covers<br>
and heavy bundles of crisp sheets,only to<br>
taunt you with alarm clocks or the necesity<br>
of a stomach ache sent by Christ himself.<br>
you can taste it, the bitterness of blood<Br>
from these dreams, and you brush your teeth,<br>
silica and fluoride, sand and water<br><br>
should you ever kiss me, i hope you taste<br>
beaches and spearmint rather than red,<br>

What’s really important to know is that my teacher had red hair, didn’t own a television, taught the class how to birdwatch, and took us out every afternoon to play ‘ragball’. I had no friends. Today everyone was making fun of me, picking on me, even the ones who sometimes came over to my house or went with me to the mall to hang out at Arby's or the Cinnabon. I couldn’t take it. When I dropped a crucial fly ball out on the field it was the straw that broke my back and I walked away crying. A couple kids called out after me, but not in a compassionate way, in a ‘Hey momma’s-boy’ kind of way. At the other end of the playground there was a square made out of four giant, cement pipes, probably used for sewage, but now used for play and to break things against. In the future they will be removed by the PTA for fear of children being hurt, which is maybe a good thing considering how reckless we would get around them, drunk with our own childlike power. Why was I passing through the cement tunnels, was it because I was blinded by tears? Perhaps. Greg and his friend Frankie were hanging out there, skulking, and they came up to me. “Hey man, why you cryin’?” These boys were professionals, everyone knew they were bullies. ”Just leeme alone.” “Why you cryin’, huh? What’s wrong with you?” They were in my face now, and so I hit Greg in the mouth, scared he would attack if given the opportunity, a preemptive strike was neccessary. Then I ran and told the teacher that Greg had tried to punch me and that his lip was bloody because of my impressive self-defense. Greg had to sit out for the rest of recess. Three years later, Junior High school, Greg transfers. I start seeing him in the hall and I am terrified. One day he approaches me: “Hey man, did you go to Emerson?” The answer, of course, is unspeakable. Greg is now much taller than me and he probably tightens his flesh over a candle at night and chews glass before going to bed. “No,” I say, “I went to Sunnyside” and Greg walks away.

Alecto’s sister Beth curled her body against the stones, and murmured to them as she attempted to braid them into her tangled hair. Her thin fingers shook with hunger, and three times she had to begin again. Here and there, she began to succeed, and soon her head was weighted down with stones trapped in wild knots. She might have been dark-haired, but the dust softened the color into a thin, pale, slate color. You have never seen such cheekbones, and such eyes; there was something framed and wild in her face, as though her eyes were longing to escape from her head entirely, and run away on their own. <br><br>

She turned her head, and the gravelly cords spun with her. There was more work to be done for the day: stones to pile. She made a circle of sixteeen cairns, and laughed deliriously at the comparitive ease of this new task. When the piles each reached her knees, she threw herself down am ongst them, pressing her skin against the prickling floor. <br><br>

"I am a circle on whose hands stand Twelve Kingdoms," she sang [and singing
is always a secret]: <br><br>

"Six are the seats of living breath: <br>

The rest are sharp sickles, or the<br>

Horns of Death." <br><br>



Dinner was not for another half an hour.<br>
<br>




"You’ll never make it across, Alecto." Her father scooped sand into his mouth, and munched at the coarse grains with his tattered teeth. He drank from his cup, and began passing the gritty water to his wife, who passed it to Alecto’s younger siblings, who clasped at it mechanically, and gingerly drank from seperate edges. Their lips seemed somehow swollen as they touched the cup. <br>
<br>


"It’s much too far, and besides, you’re quite too much an idealist, to even imagine that you might try. Its doubtful that anyone could get across that," he said, gesturing vaguely towards the featureless desert beyond the village walls. The children sat, unmoving, and stared at their rough stone plates of sand. <br>
<br>


Alecto eyed the flat land out the window wearily. The argument had lasted two days so far. An easy walk across, with not even a hill to wind her. Thats all it was. And beyond--real food, clean water: they said, in legends, that there were even milking mammals and fruit trees, berry bushes and <b>honeybees</b>, in those green hills. Why was it, she wondered, that no one had ever bothered to search those worlds, or even cross that plain? So flat, it seemed, as to make the journey look boring. Maybe it was too easy to get to the forest, too easy to enter a life that was all lushness and never stone anymore, maybe they needed the stone because without it they would float away, and everything would fall apart. She felt pebbles heavy in her stomach, and she wanted to spit. <br>
<br>


"Mom," murmured Beth suddenly, "Why not let her go? I hate sand, we’ve all got to eat food sometime, don’t we? I’m not sure we can really live, just live, on dust and sand and sticks. I can’t anyhow, I can’t bear it. And there’s no risk to you in it." <br>
<br>


Her head hang heavy with the stones and knots she’d finished that afternoon. Alecto saw Beth’s eyes flicker and widen for a moment, even further than their natural yearning allowed daily, and her arched nostrils flared. She blinked, and looked off through the window at the hills, and put her fingers up on to the edge of the slate table. Their mother saw the flared nostrils and the wide grey eyes, and sighed her mouth into a line. <br>
<br>


"Beth, it’s nonsense. Alecto is just going to have to realize that there is work to do in life, and so are you. We can’t just go skipping off into the hills and eat fruit all day. There are stones to move, and walls to build, and we’ve got to get it all done by winter. I think all this is absurd. It may seem very well to say to us that we ought to let her go, but as you grow up, you see it’s not so easy. You did a good job today, Beth, getting those stones in your hair, and building the piles, but the point is that you will have to do it all again tomorrow. That’s just the way things are." <br>
<br>


Mrs. Marshall sighed, and her gaze drifted off to the hills for a moment. Without turning her gaze, she spoke, seemingly to Alecto:<br>
<br>


"I won’t hear of you going, dear, and that’s the end of it." Her eyed remained fixed on the misty green beyond the plain for a moment longer, and then back down at the hand she held before her, brimming with dull yellow sand. She raised it to her mouth and tilted her head back, letting it slide sticky on her tongue and down her throat. Alecto frowned. She could not eat.<br>
<br>




After the family had retreated to the echoing chambers that they kept at the back of the cave, Alecto slipped out of the mouth and into the dusty blue night. She inhaled through flared nostrils: the night was as dry and unmagical as ever, but she could smell something in it. Something she found unfamiliar: it added a faint trace of heat to the air, like the burn from sun or a sandstorm. Her eyes widened and watered slightly with this newness. It was the right night for something new. <br>
<br>


Spice. A word she had heard before, but without understanding what it might evoke for a more learned listener. Spice. What was it? Heat, passion, essense, glamour, superfluity, something added to food? None of this meant anything yet: she had never tasted food, or really felt temperature, or been stirred to anything but escape. She had never been able to tell what was and was not necessary, in life. It seemed to her unnecessary to build walls around the villiage, or move rocks from the ground into piles, or even to determine the hour or time of year in which things were to happen, when the year held so unchanging. Winter, summer, spring, and autumn all seemed to be nothing but a day of dull, oozing warmth and a night of cool dust.<br>
<br>
 

The village was a series of hollowed out burrows in the granite stones that crept like massive worms from the sand. There was nothing to the burrows, really. A chamber at the front for eating, and then private sections at the back for sleeping. The hours of the day were relegated to stone-moving of different sorts. Her father seemed to value wall-building above all. When she had asked why it was so important to build walls, he had given her a sidelong glance, all disapproval, and then they had gone for a walk. Try to understand your life, he had told her. We need walls. What do you think they might be good for? She didn’t know. She said they seemed arbitrary. I hope you understand one day, he said, how much they protect you. Alecto had once supposed that her people had made the best of a sad lack, when she was very young. But then she grew tall enough to see the hills over the neat wall around the village, and had begun to make sense of the stories she had heard. There were hills, it seemed, and within them, lushness. Food beyond mere sand, and material softer than stone. <br>
<br>


She stepped up onto the plateau before the wall, and looked behind her. The caves were all dark, rough and blue in comparison the the yellow-grey sand. In the distance she saw a few fires, little glowing stars, which flickered as shapes moved past them. The silence was cottony and crushing, not the fainted sound of shifting rock. She hunched down, and slid over the wall, like a fish in a waterfall, and as she hit the ground beyond, she began to run for the hills.<br>

she was in my dream.  we were in a forest. a forest of trees. and riley had wondered off in front of me, i had lost track of her.  frantically i searched for riley, my one true love. had i lost her forever? <Br><br>

that's when i woke up. i reached back and touched my shoulderblades and my fingers returned with blood.<Br><br>

there's not much worse than a traffic jam. yesterday i spent 3 hours in a gridlock, moving at the rate of about 400 yds. every 20 minutes. there really wasn't much to do, so i decided to survey the life in the cars around me. <br><br>
in the battered old pickup next to me, there were two grimy, scraggly looking men, chomping on toothpicks and spitting out the windows. the driver hangs one sunburned arm out the window and gestures with the other as he regales his partner with stories about such things as roadkill, or hunting. or hunting roadkill. there's something in the back of the truck, covered by a big blue tarp. i don't want to know what's under it. <br><br>
behind the truck, there was a middle aged couple in a big blue cadillac arguing about something. i couldn't tell what. the woman was waving her arms frantically and screaming at her husband, while he calmly lit a cigarette and looked out the window. to the left of the couple was a man who appeared to be suffering from extreme road rage or something of the sort. he kept clenching his jaw and making me nervous. i didn't want to be smashed into oblivion if by chance he decided to slam on the gas and be out of this mess.<br><br>
i checked back on the arguing couple. the wife kept screaming and the husband looked more and more annoyed. he flicked his cigarette butt out the window and lit up a new one. if religion is the opiate for society, then love is the opiate for life. <br><br>
moments later, my car door opens and the man from the cadillac leans in to talk to me.<br> <br>"hi. i'm ed. where ya headed?"<br>
"uh, i'm not sure. just driving really."<br>
"oh. i was headed to boston when i got in a fight with my old woman. she's a real wench sometimes."<br>

<tr bgcolor="white"><td>In the world of neverland. . . some time ago. . . <br><br>

There was an amazing pair of ADIDAS GAZELLE shoes <br>
The shoes were owned by a farmer in the country <br>
This farmers name was David <br>
David was 67 years old, and owned two tractors <br><br>

David had acquired the magic pair of shoes quite some time ago <br>
He was a young lad, working in the garden (garden of ignorance) <br>
David was planting some seed into the ground at about ten a.m. <br>
David had been working in the garden since early that same morn <br><br>

Now David was young, and did not know of the world<br> 
David knew lots about plants <br>
David knew lots about soil <br>
David knew nothing, nothing at all about the Driver <br><br>

David's parents made a decision by not making a decision <br>
They chose to never inform their young son of the dangers <br>
The dangers of the world were vast, and easily used <br>
But David knew nothing of this <br><br>

David played in the sandbox with tractors<br> 
David planted seeds in the morning hours<br> 
David dreamed of tractors <br>
David fell into blue, without even knowing it <br><br>

As the books says, "David was working in the garden since early <br>
In the morning. David was bending down (planting seeds).<br> 
He was working very hard, and the morning sun had appeared.<br> 
For these two reasons David began to sweat. <br><br>

He reached for The Rag in his back pocket to remove the enormous <br>
Amount of sweat that had accumulated on his forehead. <br>
He stood up and wiped the large amount of sweat that was <br>
Dripping off his forehead. As he did the previous he noticed something. <br><br>

What he noticed was a man approaching him with a box in his hand. <br>
The man was the Driver. He was called this name because he was a <br>
Traveling salesman and drove from rural community to rural community. <br>
He sold David many items, which he treasured dearly and hid away." <br><br>

Now, this was the time that David had purchased the magic shoes <br>
Of course he did not know they were magic <br>
David never let his parents see what he had done <br>
His parents never asked what David did, but why should they <br><br>

David inherited the farm and worked in the gardens. . . He was happy. . . <br><br> </td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="white"><td>Red and black the swords flashed over our heads tied to train tracks. Were the trains coming? Indeed they were. I could feel the rumble through the Earth, that heralded the coming of the train. Rumble. Rumble. The train turned it's way about the corner in the far distance, around the pine trees, pointing at heaven. I was wriggling the best that I knew how, trying to free myself. The outcome of the sword fight going on between two people, was sure to determine my own fate. I was sure of that, even as I wriggled, and rubbed my wrists tied with rope on the edge of the train track plank. The two men fighting were Fredrick and Octavio. They were both accomplished. Beside me was a girl, a girl I had whispered into the ear of. She was struggling against her bonds as well. She looked to me every once in a while, and gave me a steely glance. I didn't think that she hoped for me to get myself out of the mess. Her man was Octavio, mine Fredrick. They both had stock in the winning of the sword fight. It wasn't just a malice on behalf of one, while they other was trying to save an innocent soul, simply mixed up in the situation through one or more of life's devices.<br> <br> 
I liked life, all in all. I found it strange that the girl next to me cursed life. I thought, "Imagine that. Being put here to suffer?" I think I said it too loud, because she gazed at me again, and then she spit at me. Her spit landed on my nose, and dripped it's way downwards into the coal dust dirt below us. She had a princess dress on. It was a nice number. She dressed up to the nines for this event. It was a blue dress, it had gold inlays and a gold turtle fashioned brooch. I wore a suit and tie. My hat had blown off in the wind while I was being tied down. It was midday. <br> <br> 

There was a ball awhile back. And with this girl next to me I had danced. We were incognito. I knew not her identity, she knew not mine. She had a way to the way she moved, and it was glorious. At midnight I ran out of the hall, because we were to take off our masks. I was uninvited to the party. I felt intrusive. But I kissed her hand before I left. It was a slender hand, one could see the bones straight to the knuckles where her fingers began, that were held by mine for my lips to touch them briefly.<br> <br> I came to this station to wait for the train. I was to go on a trip. This girl, the very one tied next to me was there as well.<br> <br> 

So I turned to this girl next to me, then, and I asked, "Are you waiting for the same thing I'm waiting for?" And she said (her with her long brown hair and her brown eyes and her sharp nose (not so sharp like you'd cut yourself on it, but sharp like she was a sharp girl.))<br> <br> 

And she said, "I don't know when the train is coming in."
"That's not the question I asked."<br> <br> 

"That's the only question you need to know, because in a few minutes, which is now, when the birds on the building framing us begin to sing our song, and we are dancing, spinning without our feet touching the porch, when we're dancing with your arm on the small of my back, and my arms draped around your neck, you'll look into my eyes, and you'll say, when is the train coming in? And then you'll realize that you don't care when the train comes in, because as we dance on this porch, this Polish porch, this Polish pine porch (but I've never been to Poland she says, and then she says, well, it doesn't matter) without our feet aren't touching the ground (because when that roll call came in, the one that gave us the directions to put our feet on the ground, we were out climbing trees) and as we twist, and spin, and our feet don't touch the ground, and we don't ever again have to stand on our tippy toes, because that would be bordering on redundant, and as we hang our feet off of sea walls, letting the spray salt our feet, I asked, looking into her eyes, "When is the train coming in?"<br> <br> 

And she said, "Shhhhh, don't fall out of step."
I think she remembered the way I danced at the ball awhile back, and this is how she recognized me.<br> <br> 

The fight is getting awfully close to us tied to these tracks. They are, in their scuffling, throwing dirt onto our faces. I think what my man is trying to do is get close enough that he can slash away my bonds, before that train comes too close. I give him moral support. I try to start a wave, but the girl next to me does not participate, and it doesn't come out looking like the ones at the stadiums. I also boo the other man. This Octavio. I believe he may be related somehow to the other person tied to the tracks. It doesn't seem as if there is any sort of sexual tension or anything like that. She keeps quiet. I think she is cursing under her breath. She looks bored otherwise. I think she told me at one point to shut up with all my carrying on.
<br> <br> 
"Ah! But he needs my support. Perhaps you could cheer on your man. You can see for yourself how well my cheering is doing. I believe Fredrick has the upper hand."
<br> <br> 
"Harumph!"
<br> <br> 
We got along quite well. In spite of being from feuding families and all. I was ready to cut all ties with my family, as was she. That was at the height of our love for each other. It was the golden age persay. And then we were married and it worked quite well. I went to work, and she stayed at home and took care of our modest living arrangement. We gave up many riches to be together. Our families were wealthy, powerful families. My father, as well as hers, had dinner with the president at least three times a year, but of course at different dinners, because they were feuding. Our families called every once in a while, but they never visited us. We had to go to them. It wasn't a real family relationship for me, really. It was more like I had gone to college with these people, and so we made a date every year to get together and talk about what we had done with our lives. But I was the guy with the broken family relationship, the one whose wife drinks too much and sold the kids to buy more booze, and so I had to make all of it up. A great weight appearing on my shoulders and my eyes would be bagged. Of course eventually I would open up to the closest of them, who would be the funny, yet uncommonly caring one, who would say things work themselves out. I think through these family meetings we started to grow apart.
<br> <br> 
I think each family would point out the shortcomings of our respective spouses, and we started to notice them more. Those things that every married couple deals with, but they realize that they do not matter in the run of things. That we are happy, and that it isn't ever going to be that storybook marriage, because love doesn't work that way, and besides, happily ever after is boring. But she started to notice how I would make sandwiches, and leave the crumbs around on the table, and she would say that it wasn't so much the crumbs, but how they symbolized that I was at heart an unthinking person. That I should realize that she will have to pick up the crumbs that I leave behind. And for me, I noticed that she thought she was perfect. She thought, though not aloud, that really she was better than me. I think she had to be, in order for the relationship to work. But I pointed out that this mindset often leads to people that are caring on the outside, but don't really acknowledge fully that there are others around, with real needs and pains and what have you. So we ended up spending less time hanging our feet off of sea walls, letting them become sticky with salt, and just looking out on the horizon, waiting for the sun to rise all orange and soft. We held hands less. We decided to have children.<br> <br> 

Luckily we ended up here before the children came. Because now I realize that we fell into that age old mistake of thinking that children will bring people closer together. That they, with their cute noses and little grasping fingers, can do certain things which they are quite uncapable of.<br> <br> 

There was an office building next door to the tracks. I think they often had things delivered through the system of rails that criss- crosses the country. I was hoping someone would see what was going on, and run outside with their tie flapping back to help untie us. It would be lunch time soon though, and I figured people would come out to sit on the picnic tables in the back yard.<br> <br> 

Octavio had his hand grasped to Fredrick's sword arm, and was trying to cut his belly open. Fredrick is quick though, and he jumps back at the correct times to avoid Octavio's sword thrusts.<br> <br> 

Ah! It is lunch time, and I can see the first of the workers exit the building. Some have cafeteria trays and others have lunches in bags. I call out. "Here! Here!" Some of them sit on the picnic tables, while others with little smiles sit upon the grass with their legs crossed. The boss comes out, I think, and pats some of them on the back. He stops at certain tables and laughs with the workers. Some of the women look approvingly at the boss, while the men look approvingly at the women, their left hands below the tables. There is a basketball hoop set up in the parking lot, and some of the workers roll up their shirtsleeves and play the game. No one hears my calls. "Help! Help!" My ex- wife next to me, says not a word. She just sits and stares at the sky. Her jaw is closed quite tightly. I think she was expecting me to be more heroic.<br> <br> 

The train is much closer now. I can make out the grill, or cow pusher as it were, if I strain my head up and look out through my feet. The rumbling is very much worse. I don't think I will be able to rub the bonds enough to fray and eventually tear them. The fight is at a standstill it seems. Both men have stopped and grabbed a water bottle off of the train station platform. Octavio brought oranges and is helping himself to them. He throws a couple Fredrick's way, who eats them up.<br> <br> 

I tried to talk to her, but it was hard to turn my neck all the way to the right and talk convincingly at the same time. "We can work this out." "I love you, and don't want to lose you." "You mean the world to me." "What will I do without you?"<br> <br> 

Tears then came to her eyes as she continued to look up at the sky with her jaw clenched. I knew she still loved me, because I could see the tears run one by one down the side of her cheek, and hear them fall into the dust underneath us. She was a stubborn person.<br> <br> 

When she stopped her crying she talked to me, still looking up. "It can't go back the way it was." "I love you, but it's not that easy." "Don't make this harder on me than it already is."
<br> <br> 
Fredrick and Octavio had resumed their fighting. The tension was raised now that the train was closer, surely you can understand that. My insides were being rolled around inside of my body because the train is quite rumbly. It blows that whistle deal they always blow in situations like these.<br> <br> 

Ah! We have been run over and squished by the mighty wheels of the locomotive! Fredrick and Octavio are in fits of despair. "Why? Oh why?" I see that they are blaming the squishedness on themselves. They see that they should not have been fighting over us, but really should have been untying us. They see that now. They hug, console each other over the great tragedy at hand.<br> <br> 

Eventually they sit on the train platform and finish the oranges together in a sense of comradery.<br><br> </td></tr>

In 1938, The third Reich under
        Adolph Hitler attempted to annex Australia. This was met
        with worldwide resistance, and soon the United States was
        drawn into war. </font><p>The
        American navy had the most success in this conflict , but
        even their tight shooting and cunning seamanship could
        not make up for Hitler&#146;s naval advances. </font></p>
        <p><b>U-boats off the coast of

        <p>What was needed was a new
        strategy: bloodthirsty revenge. To show the Germans what
        American military muscle could do on the high seas: This
        was the American way, and this is the story of the men of
        that mission:</font></p>

        <p>The captain gets furious whenever

        left his village in ruins. The youngest of three boys no
        longer. The father, dead.</font></p>
        <p>&#147;Jimmy, nobody hates the

        <p>On the third watch that night,
        Patrolmen Sikes and Jones watched for German u-boats with
        their night-vision binoculars. </font></p>
        <p>&#147;Do you see anything, Sikes?&#148;</font></p>
        <p>&#147;No, Jones.&#148;</font></p>

        <p>&#147;Yes, ever since we moved
        into northern Atlantic waters to avoid German U-boats the
        seas have been much rougher- the air colder.&#148;</font></p>
        <p>&#147;I know. What I wouldn&#146;t
        give to be back with my girl in Texas, going to a theater
        cinema movie or eating popcorn all buttered up. I look up,
        and see all the stars. And I wonder, Is she lookin&#146;
        up too, thinkin&#146; about me?&#148;</font></p>
        <p>&#147;I wrote a poem like that.

        <p>&#147;I wish I thought of that.
        While you were saying that I thought of the following
        Idea:</font></p>
        <p>In a flash, German U-boats filled
        the Atlantic, rising up into the sky in piles. They tried
        to shoot torpedoes, but torpedoes don&#146;t work out of
        water. They were sitting ducks for our B 24 planes. What
        do you think about that?&#148;</font></p>
        <p>&#147;I think you should tell the

The vocals and lo-fi production aesthetic bring just the right touch of off-kilter authenticity that makes music human. Some people find this sort of thing pretentious, I suppose, but to me, there's nothing more pretentious than hiring seven sound men to make sure that there's no crackle in your high notes or blow out on your bass drum. Toy Musclecar isn't going to bombard you with hiss the way cheap sebadoh B-sides do, but you know nobody was spending thousands for studio time trying to get the perfect levels in case they want to make a pepsi commercial. <br><br>

Instead, Toy Musclecar aims to capture the weird conflicting sense of joy that comes from knowing that all life is going to have its share of pain. There's a zen parable of sorts about a guy who breaks his leg, and his zen master chastises him to be grateful for the broken leg because a broken leg is the only leg he has at all. If these songs sound triumphant, it is a triumph with a twist of surrender, too. It makes for a truly, truly terrific listen for me now, as the piles of snow in my yard begin to dissolve into the mud, with grass still waiting patiently for some sort of cue.<br><br>

But the green will burst through! This record makes me sure of it.

No one was sure about how God got inside of the Egg, but it was certain amongst them all that it had. There could be no doubting it. "You've just got to hold the egg, to be able to tell." it was said. Herb Whitman, farmer of 52 years, son of the famous Whitman something-or-other. They manufactured eggs for as long as eggs were being produced in this part of Ohio, which was as long as anyone could remember or trace back in newspaper archives.<br><br>
"God itself is in that there egg."<br><br>

The farmers agreed that it would be in their best interest if each one of them cared for it nightly, so as none had to have the pressure of caring about such a heavy egg. Eli Whitman had obtained a black magic marker.<br><br>

"Good idea, Eli," said Herb. Brothers are always good at stuff like that, like when you have the Egg that has the Truth inside and your brother has a magic marker, you know exactly what the plan is. <br><br>
Herb wrote "Truth" on the egg and stopped.<br><br>

"Should I write that it's an egg?" said Herb.<br><br>

"I think we can tell that it's an Egg." replied Eli.<br><br>

That night they flipped a coin to see who would keep the Egg with them for the night. Eli lost, and had to take it. Neither of them minded, as it was the first day that either of them was in charge of the egg. But they knew it might start to be a burden soon, and so Herb was happy he would have one night left without the burden.<br><br>

Eli had placed it inside his icebox. He considered that maybe the egg shelf was a bad place, but since it was labeled "Truth" it was unlikely that anyone would eat it.<br><br>

He slept soundly that night, but kept thinking maybe keeping God in the ice box wasn't enough. The next day he called Herb on the phone.<br><br>

"Herb, you think that maybe we should do more than what we're doing?" he asked. <br>
"Like what?"<br>
"Well, gee. I dunno. More."<br>
"Maybe. But we don't know what's what with it, so we best not do nothin." The double negative caused no confusion: Brothers are good that way.<br><br>

Herb kept it that night, but he couldn't sleep. He would wake up often to go to the icebox, and cup the egg, gently in his hands. He would rub it in his hands, breath on it. He decided maybe he shouldn't keep it in the icebox, but maybe leave it out, somewhere more warm. He put it on a pillow and put a heat lamp on it.<br><br>


"Now what in the blazes is that?" asked Eli the next morning. 
"Nothin. Just maybe we should leave it warm."
"Leave it warm? You want a brown egg? Eggs don't tan, Herb."
"I know sure as hell an egg don't tan. Why'd I want to tan an egg for?"<br><br>


Eli said nothing. When he took it, it made him a bit worried. He worked all day and the egg went unwatched. So he came up with a plan, to keep the egg with him at all times.<br><br>


He got a tiny box and filled it with cotton and with soft things. Eli wasn't used to soft things, he had farmers hands, covered with calluses like yellowed toenails stuck on onion skins. But they turned into ballerinas when arranging cotton for the egg. The box was a tiny wooden jewelry box he found in the yard once, by the road. It looked like a squared off acorn and had little silver latches, one of which was broken. He put an egg inside the box and shook it around a while. When he was convinced it would be safe, he opened up the box and switched the egg with the God egg. Then he went to farm, always keeping his eye on the box.<br><br>


He wasn't sure why, but he farmed like he was 40 years younger that day. Now, it was only a flower garden, but in his age, he found pulling up weeds as hard as pulling up a whole field of potatoes in his twenties. He worked like mad that day, he worked without thinking. He worked like a machine; in the days of his hard labor he would imagine he was a plow, converting calories into money for him and his family. It was a pure feeling he had forgotten. It was, he remembered, what he had in constant supply as a child, what led him to this immortal feeling. He had lost the ability later- his body would not keep up his illusion. But today, his spirit was kindled, and he was empty, filled to the brim of his skin with sensations.<br><br>


He gave the egg to his brother that night, saying nothing of his day, but smiling a bit broadly at the sight of him.<br><br>


Herb kept it underneath the lamp again, all night and day. The box his brother made was safer than the pillow, so he used that. He would read the paper, but it left a bitter taste in his mouth today. The secret pleasures he used to have, belittling the decay of morality and the state of the world, was gone. He was beginning to worry about it. It was big, he imagined, almost too big. He closed the paper on itself like a priest folding a robe at the end of a sermon, and went to watch TV in the other room, but mostly watched flies buzzing against the bug light like race car drivers crashing into the sun.<br><br>


He got up to go to bed, stopping by his fridge to get some turkey leftovers. He eyed the egg in the corner like a hungry puppy, and went outside. In his robe and boxers and blue and red socks, he turned off the bug lamp, whispering a little something before the blue light faded.<br><br>

When Eli came, he saw Herb was still asleep, at in the afternoon. He took the egg, and the magic box, and went to town, for his Saturday coffee and haircut.<br><br>


The townspeople were so amused by Eli's egg that they all forgot to buy anything. The store managers weren't concerned either, as they were wondering if there was some way to turn the eggs novelty into a sales pitch. Children ran into the streets with balloons and kittens frolicked, knocking over bottles. Young men, fighting in the streets, stopped to look at the egg. Policemen called over known criminals to look at the egg, and then put quarters in the meters they were supposed to ticket. It was just that kind of day. Eli's haircut was free of charge, said the barber, patting him on the back. "Just make sure you bring back that precious egg!"<br><br>


Eli felt so good and so young that he began to run home, all the way up hills and across the rickety red bridge that was built the year he was born. By night fall, he was so exhausted he tumbled into bed, the egg placed onto a night stand.<br><br>


Herb wandered in with bags under his eyes. He stood at the doorway, looking at Eli with his glow, and grabbed the egg. He took it to his house, and put it under the heat lamp. He played rock and roll music for the egg; he covered it with feathers. He stared at it all night, but nothing happened. When his brother came in the next afternoon, he was still. He was staring at the egg.<br><br>


"Herb," asked Eli, "what's going on here?"
"It's the inside that counts. We've got to see what's inside that there egg. Maybe just a chicken."
"There's no chicken in that God damned egg, Herb. That's one thing for sure, is that ain't no goddamned chicken."<br><br>


Herb looked at Eli, and Eli said nothing else in response to the skull sockets his brother had for eyes. You didn't have to be his brother to know it.<br><br>


Eli wasn't allowed to take the egg that night. Herb said Eli could watch it for four hours while he took a nap, and fell asleep on top of the box. Herb didn't wake up for about 24 hours. Eli began to worry about the egg, afraid that maybe he would never get the egg again, would never feel the youth in his bones, the passion in his heart.<br><br>


His brother slept. The day turned into a day and a few hours, and that's when Eli went outside, read the newspaper, and then came inside again. He shook his brother, but there was no response. He took his brothers pulse.<br><br>


He stood, hand behind his head for a bit. Then he rolled his brother over, took the box from beneath him, and went home. Poured himself a cup of coffee, walked over to the box. He took out the egg, washed it until it was white. He went to the henhouse and got a fresh egg, put it in the box, and walked it over to his brothers, sliding it onto his bed.<br><br>


"Pretty long sleep, ey?" said Eli, the next morning.<br>
"Sure." said Herb, wandering into his kitchen. <br>
"How's the egg?" Eli asked.<br>
"I got something to tell you." said Herb. "I did a bad thing."<br>
They were quiet for a while. <br>
"Its alright," said Eli. "It's alright."<br>

How my cries eventually deafened my ears, and how eventually there was not much left of me, but skin and bone, and a lung to breathe in the barely recycled air. In carbon dioxide out carbon dioxide. All magic was lost, if you know what I mean. I sat on the edge of a precipice for days. My feet dangled off of the edge, and now and then I'd watch a pebble, or many pebbles, fall downwards. And sometimes birds flew beneath me, but I didn't notice them, not really. Sometimes my arms would fall off, and I would have to put them back on. Butterflies went by, but I told them, "Butterflies, you will make a fibrous envelope called a cocoon, in time. Perhaps it will make it through, perhaps it will be blown from it's place where you have spun it to the side of a bulkhead." Below me, was a lot of sand. And really, that's all I saw down there.<br><br>

Once, when I was a boy, I noticed the train tracks leading away from my town. I lived in a small town that was a place to be born, and also a place to die, and that was pretty much how things happened there. Like anywhere else, it just seemed to be more pressurized there. The sky was not a friend in an area like that. It bore down on you. It was looking for oil in your heart.<br><br>

These things happened there.
<br><br>
The train tracks led out across the ocean, supported by a jetty of rocks. It was quite apparent that the jetty could give away. I decided to build a ship. But not a ship to balance on the top of the water, but a ship for the railroad tracks leading outwards towards mountains in the distance. In the evening they were backlighted by the sun. In my basement, I sewed a sail, and I built a boat out of wood. I put metal wheels on it that I had found, to fit on the tracks like a train. I made the boat small. I made the boat fairly cozy, with an icebox and some sandwiches, because I did not know how long my journey would be.<br><br>

"It might be a long journey," I explained.<br><br>

My friend Jessica was going to go on the journey along with me. She was a nervous girl, and did not know if she would go. Of course she ended up going with me. She made several sandwiches, and took several drinks.<br><br>

The boat contraption, I called her Desire, was finished with a pleasant paint job in my basement. We made a ramp from the basement to the outside, over the bulkhead stairs. I pulled, and Jessica pushed the boat up the stairs, until the front wheels, and then the back wheels, dropped onto the grass. It was then easy going. We pulled it to the street, took a right, and would not stop to look back. Jessica at one point wanted to, but I expressed my ideas that it would not be wise to look behind us as we pulled our boat along.<br><br>

The metal wheels creaked against the small stones set in the street. It grew dark rather ominously (and if we pulled the boat fast enough, sparks would appear about the wheels and the pavement) as we made it to the hill, that on the other side began the ocean, or lake.<br><br>

The thing is, is that we had been alone in some sort of desert landscape (very few things, except for grains of sand) for a long time. Or at least that is what we assumed, though there weren't any jackrabbits, or cacti with their spines that protect them from hungry animals, or ringtails. No sidewinders. I was sure that there was no such desert landscape in my town. Though surely there it was. As we came through the bushes out of the Pinskey's backyard, and were heading across Maple Street, there it was, and we were in it. The maps that I had studied did not inform me of this wasteland. Even Ms. Huntington, our geography teacher, never told us about this.<br><br>

"I think we have been in this desert like landscape," Jessica said, "with it's every once in a while tumbleweeds, for a long time."<br><br>

"I agree. Though I am not positive of my agreement. I really have no idea as to how long we have been here."<br><br>

We had forgotten our brand name sports watches, with the alarms and timers and things.<br><br>

"Has the sun passed over our heads?" Jessica asked.<br><br>

"I do not know. In fact, I don't even know where the sun is."<br><br>

"You're right. I can not find the sun.," and then, "So what are we going to do?"<br><br>

"Jessica, I really don't know."<br><br>

The sun never seemed to pass over our heads. Or perhaps it did, because I think there was a time when we both had fallen asleep for a time.<br><br>

When we weren't sleeping there was a conversation involving knives.<br><br>

What's yours like? Serated?<br>
Knives? Fully forged.<br>
Hmmmm, polypropylene?<br>
It appears that way. <br>
It says it on the box.<br>
Yes it does.<br>
There was an argument over the appropriate knives to buy for our kitchen.<br>
But we don't have a kitchen yet. Not our own anyway.<br>
Which made it more difficult.<br>
Indeed. <br>
Very much so. <br>
Yes.<br>
"The humble origins of vast factories."<br>
The vast origins of humble factories?<br>
No, the other way around, vice versa.<br>
Oh, I see. It makes a lot more sense that way.<br>

I explained to Jessica, though she knew it already, that I had been to kindergarten several times.<br><br>

Kindergarten four times! Imagine my embarrassment!<br><br>

She rubbed her hand on my back and said, "There, there."<br><br>

In time we decided to at least move somewhere. For a while we did concentric circles, around and around, and let where we began get further and further away with each rotation. It wasn't hot though, which was a plus considering how much we walked around and around. No backpacks or nothing. That was good as well. Around and around in the sand that made it hard to move kind of. Eventually we couldn't be sure if we were really moving away from the center, or possibly we had skewed the calculations, and were actually passing the original spot in each rotation; just lengthening one part of the circle.<br><br>

We sat down for awhile. Walked on for awhile. Eventually decided to turn our circle into a straight line.<br><br>

"At least somewhere, then?" said Jessica.<br><br>

It was really her idea, the walking in straight lines thing.<br><br>

And eventually we got to the top of the hill, where beyond was the expanse of water, made into thousands of little waves all about the larger waves, coming in crooked at the shore, by the wind that was there.<br><br>

Like a bullet, or an arrow, or something equally as straight, were the train tracks that led on the thin (just big enough for the tracks, and a strip of small stones underneath the tracks, that extended out a small distance on either side of them) jetty, to the horizon, which was blurred a bit, perhaps in a fog.<br><br>

Ships passed in the distance, with pirate flags. They had treasure I am sure. They had pirates with various colored beards. Blue, red, yellow, white, black, magenta perhaps, perhaps green. The sun was setting.<br><br>

Once on the track, the wind took us quite vigorously through the sea. Dolphins followed us, jumping, whining that song they sing when they whine. Giant tortoises like islands were there too. We traveled. Things happened.<br><br>

One night, I was asleep, when Jessica woke me up pointing out in front of us. She did not speak a word then. I looked out ahead, and saw that a large portion of our track and jetty was missing. The rocks of the jetty made splashes now and then as they tumbled to the water. I saw the tail of a sea serpent swim by, I thought perhaps it was the sea serpent's doing, this break in our path. Jessica jumped out of the back of the boat, and put her heels in to try and stop our forward movement, while I lowered the sail. We slowed down in plenty of time, really.<br><br>

I was tied, with white silk cord, to a seat in a barn when the Queen came in. There were no animals, and I guess the wood floors were replaced with some sort of white stone. There was a door that swung on it's loud hinges in front of me. Outside I could see what was left of the fields. Cornstalks were bent and broken in rows and rows of dark yellow. The sky was low, and the horizon was on fire. She walked quickly, with important strides. Her gown swung in towards me when she halted before me.<br><br>

"Where is Jessica?" I said.<br><br>

She had a servant pour us some tea. "All in good time," was what I thought she was going to say, but instead she said, "Your friend is dead. Long live the queen!"<br><br>

Rats scurried about our feet, and snakes curled themselves about our ankles slowly, making their way towards our mouths and our noses. Jessica screamed, and coughed out one. I was working furiously at the cords when John rode up and cut us free.<br><br>

"Thank you John."<br><br>

I thought we could wait for low tide, and perhaps the sunken portion of the jetty would reappear, but we were too far to sea for that plan to work. So we just pushed the boat into the water (splash) and floated across, and pulled the boat back onto the jetty, and continued our way. Before we could pull our boat back onto the jetty though, we sank a good deal. Right to the bottom of the ocean. When we were standing on the sand at the bottom, and seeing organisms swim by, Jessica began untying her sneakers. She was just floating there, almost sideways untying them. We then tied the boat to us by our shoelaces, and swam to the surface.<br><br>

Back in the boat, the mountains got closer and bigger, and since the wind had picked up in our direction, these two characteristics increased quickly. It looked as though we would have to scale the mountains; leave the boat behind, just take our sandwiches. But as luck would have it, there was an opening into the side of the cliff, so we just followed the track through a tunnel. It was dark. It could have been scary, but it wasn't. We came out onto a valley with a purple lake, and in the distance, there was quite accordingly, a castle, with shining battlements. And I could see a long golden lock of hair, even from here, hanging out of the window, blowing in the breeze.<br><br>

<tr bgcolor="white"><td>They waited all winter for the stoat to come. But, in the end, they didn’t really know what a stoat was. Or a cockatiel, or an ocelot. But they hoped she would come, they hoped in the fort at night, peering out at the snow and whispering. The whispers didn’t carry far in the whirling snow, whispers never do. The fort was the only possible building. In the snow it was a satellite that spun among pygmy stars.<br><Br>

Janice said, “What do you think she looks like?”<br><Br>

“I heard maybe a little like a dog,” said Paul, “or a ferret.”<br><Br>

“But a ferret is nothing like a dog!”<br><Br>

“Well, you know how it is when you’re not sure, when something’s new. You try to sandwich it in some kind of spectrum. I don’t know.”<br><Br>

They sat in silence for a while.<br><Br>

“I think the stoat is Holy,” said Janice, definitively.<br><Br>

“Yes,” replied Paul.<br><Br>

The snow would never end and the stoat would never come. The snow would end tomorrow and the sun would burst through the blue and the stoat would come leaping up to them, dazzlingly bright. She was a terrible one to wait for. What if she were very small, what if she were too big to see? They loved the stoat. She was everything to them. When the river froze, they began by hoping that she would now be able to cross. But soon they were afraid. They would wake up at midnight, shaking.<br><Br>

“Paul,” Janice gasped as she hurtled around the last curl of the spiral staircase that led to the watchtower, “what if she thinks she can cross and then the ice breaks? What if she is too heavy?” Tears streamed down her face. Paul turned and a dusty blue sunbeam turned him into a ghost.<br><Br>

“It’s impossible,” he told her. “The stoat is too powerful.”<br><Br>

They learned to cast iron and made a huge bell to sit on top of the watchtower, but never knew if they should ring it. Would it be too loud? Would it frighten the stoat? Or was it desperately necessary? Was she lost and waiting for the guidance of the bell? They were paralyzed. Everything depended upon the stoat. Paul and Janice rarely spoke: the anxiety silenced them. How could they speak? How could they move? There was no way to know what the stoat wanted, or if she wanted anything, or if she knew what wanting was.<br><Br>

The fort began to look like a cathedral. They learned to cut colored glass and made pictures of their imagined stoats. They worried that the stoat would not like them and took them down. They worried that she would like them and put them back up. They left the glass in and bright colors danced across the room. They thought she might like that. <br><Br>

One day Janice silently removed all the snow around the fort as far as fifty feet out. When she finished it suddenly struck her that the stoat could be trapped in the pile of snow she had made and she fell to her knees and could not move. Paul found her and carried her up to the watchtower. She lay by him silently while he scanned the horizon with his binoculars. The tower ground about in its usual circle and despite the owl’s vision this afforded them, they could not help but glance over their shoulders every moment or two. Then, terrified that in that glance, they had lost a possible stoat sighting elsewhere, they whirled again. And again and again. <br><Br>

They had no parents and no books. There was no mythology to inform them. <br><Br>

“But,” said Janice, “I just have this sureness that the stoat will come.”<br><Br>

“Yes,” said Paul. “Its as though she were almost here, as though she were standing behind us all the time.”<br><Br>

“I want her to stand in front of me,” said Janice. “I feel as though we are meant to do something we haven’t yet done.”<br><Br>

The blankets were warm and when spring began to break through they took their turns at sleeping outside while the other watched from the tower. <br><Br>

“In spring the stoat is sure to come,” said Janice, with hope.<br><Br>

“Yes,” said Paul.<br><Br>

Paul lost his voice and did not know how to write. So Janice began to tell him stories that she imagined for the stoat. Otherwise he would have become invisible, and she would never find him again. She needed him. The stoat needed him. So stories would solidify him. Nobody ever loses their voice, she reasoned privately, unless they are preparing to be lost from the senses. <br><Br>

“When the stoat comes, it will teach us to fly. It will take the thorns off of our roses with its small hands. Then the roses will grow forever up into the sky. We will all fly together. You and me and the stoat.” Paul nodded.<br><Br>

Janice developed an anxious insomnia and could not stop eating. She became afraid that if she ate meat, it might be stoat meat, and so she became vegetarian. She ate salad from an empty milk gallon with the top third cut off. She was always hungry. Paul learned how to cook lentils for her and that was a great help. They grew spices in the garden and she would tell him stories, always about the stoat. Paul listened very carefully to everything she said.<br><Br>

One night in the watchtower, Paul turned to Janice. He looked up into her eyes. Two miles away behind them, an apple dropped out of an apple tree. Janice’s eyes reflected a switch on the control board. Ten miles beyond the apple tree, a thousand albino spiders hatched and fled like stars. Janice blinked and the switch disappeared momentarily. Then it was back. <br><Br>

this is how the dream begins. kimberly from years ago, her awful name always in full, in full day-glo glory, is standing among the used pizza boxes that make up an abandoned construction site. there are thousands of these in malls, but instead we exist, suddenly but without change, in the middle of nowhere. kimberly wants to kiss me, and this is every taboo at once. her mouth is all i can see, the pinkness is overwhelming. <br><br>

only just after i wake up can i imagine myself sleeping beside her, and i can never quite reproduce her lips. <br><br>

we walk along a rainy path. the trees move in close, brushing us. there is water on my clothing, thousands of tiny eyes on my blue rain jacket. kimberly wears white leather. what does water do to material like that? for kimberly, it does absolutely nothing.<br><br> 

what does pizza represent? the empty boxes are a metaphor for human experience, just like everything else in a dream. pizza is a food that i have never ever savored, but always enjoyed. a construction site is a communist country. half-built office buildings are warnings our nation's parents give to their children. these children, like me, go on to imitate business supply catalogues. <br><br>

kimberly speaks again. she tells me the same story about the same three people. in dreams, people talk to me only by telepathy, so naturally they sound exactly like me. <br><br>

"we can only suppose that fred was not-completely-dead, elise was obsessed with mice, and Yanni never got out much. how they all ended up in the same subway car at 11:36 on a sunday morning is a complete mystery to me. funny things happen in threes." <br><br>

she sings. she sings the instrumental chorus to the first song of the day on rock radio in a day-dreaming voice that is lighter than the lightness of all the weightless pebbles draped around her neck combined. <br><br>

Sources say the men appeared to be mentally handicapped, and were wearing earflaps and sunglasses.  
One of the men may or may not have been wearing flip flops.  Residents of this small town of less than 400 were
promptly ecvacuated by city officials worried of a potential riot.  Emotions are still tense, but the residents have been
allowed back in their homes and the 2 suspects remain in custody.  They are scheduled to be arraigned sometime next week.  Both suspects

again. And this time
it's not because of
driving too fast or
taking something that
didn't belong to me.<br><br> I
was trespassing on the
roof of Kessling School.
And I know I shouldn't
have been there. We were
playing soccer and the
ball got stuck up on the
roof.<br><br> One thing led to
another and there I was.
Next thing I know, cops
are there. I'm being
spoken to through a
bullhorn. And I don't
even get a chance to
explain myself. It was
midnight, which made it
weird. Because they
wanted to know why we
were kicking a soccer
ball around at midnight.<br><br>
Plus they wanted to know
why we had the glass-cutting equipment and 
like 8 cans of
spraypaint. But we just
had them. We just
happened to have all
that stuff.<br><br> And why we
were drunk. But it was
late and we just were.
We just happened to be
drunk. And my parents
have got their new tough-love thing and won't bail
me out or help me out at
all.<br><br> So can you do me a

Despite being nearly broke and having no commercial support, they took over the underground in just a couple of years thanks to brilliant songwriting, heartfelt &amp; sincere lyrics, and a unique blend of dark ambience and sugar coated candy pop.</p> 											<p></p> 											<p>Following their debut album <b>hot air balloons</b>, the band generated an underground buzz thanks to the fluke hit single <i>semi trucks </i>(a compelling, melodic take on modern love) which received some airplay on college radio stations nationwide. With relentless touring and energetic live shows, the band turned themselves into underground cult icons. However, tragedy struck in early 1992. The night before a sold-out show was to be played in Cincinnati, guitarist John Kooiman was found dead in his hotel room from a heroin overdose. After a yearlong merry-go-round of guitarists (including Norm Van Steenwyke - now the front man for the anti-pop outfit Violent Joe), the band finally came into contact with Ritchie Victoria, an unknown out of Indianapolis. In mid 1993, they released a new album entitled <b>black marker, dull sentence</b>, which became a massive underground hit. The album was much more coherent as a whole - seamlessly blending Victoria's darker tone with the spaced out vibe of the band, all the while drawing from the pain of losing their former guitarist.</p> 											<p>Black Marker has been described as the band's masterpiece &amp; even as one of the best albums of the decade. The entire album flows together magically - screaming melody and denial vs. pain and anger. </p> 											<p>Sadly, just 3 months after black marker hit the shelves, Ritchie Victoria committed suicide in his Indianapolis home.  </p> 											<p>The rest of the band tried to regroup, and even released a new album - <b>generation super X </b>(with newly recruited guitarist Reggie Regnerus). Despite moderate success, it lacked Victoria's signature sound and as a whole the album seemed scattered and incoherent. Just a few months after the release of generation super x, the band broke up for good. </p> 											<p></p> 											<p><i>RELATED&nbsp;ARTISTS: </i><b>Bicycles That Are Dead</b></p>

											<p><b>BIOGRAPHY<br> 
												</b>-By Bill Sutherland (AP)</p> 
											<p>Brilliant songwriter Ritchie Victoria (of Toy Musclecar fame) also released a side project just a month before his death. Using the moniker <b>Bicycles That Are Dead</b>, he toys with pseudo minimal electonica. This album cemented his legacy as a musical genius. Surprisingly quiet and melodic, yet still his dark mood is still in tact. Although the album only included 7 tracks, it weighed in over an hour long, thanks in part to the brilliant <font color="blue">24 minute</font> closer <i>please take the sunglasses back</i>.   </p> 
											<p>The album starts off with <i>staring at the wall with no smile and no name </i>which, despite it's depressing title, is quite calm and soothing. Almost bringing back memories of early classic pianists.   Next, the pounding beats and rhythmic feedback of <i>my machine gun's name is jennifer, </i>safe to say the angriest song found here - he gives us this piece filled with denial and angst. Yet midway through we find out that even Victoria's angriest moments turn into disoriented reverb and melodies as he switches gears and fades out the drums, leaving us with nothing but gruesome background sound. Tape recorded voices and atmospheric surf guitar lead us into <i>when i was younger, i had fun.  </i>Starting off slowly and leading us into a world filled with insanity, somehow the gentle surf guitars turn into reverberated noise only to yield it's way to brash distortion and slightly off key vocal harmonies - all in seamless transition.  <i>All my friends who live far away </i>takes this note and runs with it even more, giving us the same type of echoed offkey harmonies and distortion mixed with a soothing background of guitar and pounding beats.   Sensing we need a break, he gives us <i>we left the baby in the ocean </i>- a 57 second interlude of haunting beats and guitar samples.  Despite the short length, Victoria actually had a few friends come in and make cameos for this track.  It's safe to say the end result is far from what they delivered to him.  <i>a long drive home (in a red car)</i> is by far the quietest piece found here - the drums echo as if induced by sleep, while the background is filled with luscious guitarscape and delay.  The album closer adds a perfect completion to this incredible album.  <i>please take the sunglasses back</i> is Victoria at his most sincere.  Meandering around playfully for nearly 5 minutes, we finally enter the song only to find ourselves in a haunting, sick, dark place - surely a microcosm of his mind. A deliberate, hypnotizing pace drones ad infinitum. Midway through the song, after what seems like hours of slow tortured death, he finally works his way up to a melodramatic climax. A beautifully subtle and simplistic guitar solo adds the perfect finishing touch to this masterpiece. Victoria's music didn't use proper measures or time signatures, he just made his own rules and it worked - Beautifully. A brilliant album made by one of the better musicians of the last decade.</p>

Candy lay sprawled on the ground, long legs stretched, fingers spread like seaweed.<br><br>
“Damn,” she said as if she was stating the obvious. She said it again. She moved a pinky finger, lifting it slowly then letting it fall. She moved one arm upward until her hand was held directly in her view. She stared silently at her stubby fingers for a while.<br><br>

Candy then brought her hand to her stomach, to feel it rise and fall; to make sure she still breathed and was alive. She was.<br><br>

“Damn.” She didn’t want to say anything else, the silence too pressing for a sentence. She could hear her little word being swallowed by heavy air. She sat up slowly and turned to watch the grass she had been lying on stand up straight again. Some small blades were too bent and remained pressed against the dirt. She
took her cold fingers from her side and idly raised them one at a time. The breeze moved at one point, the first wind she’d felt in a long time. It smelled like it does after rain. She got to her feet and took an unsteady step. Damn. She wouldn’t say it aloud this time, vulnerable in her tallness.<br><br>

She started to walk, small stones hurting her feet. It was getting dark, shadows of trees stretching longer and longer across the field. She stepped into a shadow and sat again, leaning back on her palms, mind blank as to what she had previously stood up for. She had no reason to do anything now. She slid closer to the bank of a stream and dipped her hand into the cold water until it was numb. She felt better then, cooler and protected in the shade. She started talking again.<br><br>

“Candy. Damn it Candy.” The field was so big, so empty that it hurt her. She wanted to fill it with words.<br><br>

“What fun. What fucking fun. “ She dug her nails into the dirt and pine needles. “At least I won’t die on an airplane. Yah, I always thought I’d die on an airplane. You know what the chances of that are? I suppose though that few people die in fields.” She now lay on her back, hands behind her head, toes crossing out of the shadow and warming in the lingering sun.<br><br>

As the sun died in front of her, so too did the dandelions and so too did the autumn.

The vampire enjoyed reading poetry and playing the piano. There was not much else to do in his home, an underwater castle. He did not write lilting, spooky numbers on his pipe organ, as his father and grandfather had, but instead wrote fragile piano ballads.<br><br>
His father and grandfather both died, in spite of the long lasting family myth that vampires could not be killed. It was rather simple to kill a vampire; it is always written about them, their flair for dramatics and their troubled souls deep with longing notwithstanding, wooden spikes are fairly easy to locate, and in fact, aside from the mind-numbing fog and the ability, in some, to transform into a bat, they are not difficult enemies to conquer.<br><br>

This young vampire did not learn how to turn into a bat. He was never interested in those things. His father always berated him, he would never grow up to be a real vampire if he didn't learn to transform into a bat. Nothing would ever become of him.<br><br>

"Nothing Will Ever Become Of You!"<br><br>

But our Vampire did not listen, instead, he stayed inside and played his pipe organ all day, and he wrote poetry. His father was more impressed with the poetry, but the young vampire would not show it to him, because it was about butterflies and rainbows and not the scintillating passions of crimson tears from wrists red like roses on tombstones.<br><br>

His father had died ages ago, or flown away, or, perhaps, was seemingly dead only to linger in the hearts of men. Our vampire was alone, alone in his castle, underwater.<br><br>

He had started gazing out windows. Suddenly, what he saw outside frightened him so much that he closed the shades and hid against the wall. He had not looked out the window in daylight often; as the family tradition dictated. Being underwater, the family had a kind of resistance to normal vampire-destroying light rays.<br><br>

He closed the curtains and his chest was heaving, and he went to make himself a ham sandwich. He had some grape juice, and some potato salad. He always loved potato salad; he made it himself mostly. He finished his lunch, and went back to the window, to look outside again.<br><br>

There was nothing but what had always been; the purple rocks around his castle, the enormous plant; the sky reflecting an inverse image of his castle. Plastic and empty, it had a moat that opened and closed when certain amounts of air pressure would build up, coming in from a clear tube that led to the sky. Sometimes the noise would drive him crazy, but for the most part he was glad the water he breathed was being properly oxygenated. The world was as it always was.<br><br>

As he slept, he was haunted by the image; scaley, orange-gold; floating in the sky, staring at him with big, empty eyes. He awoke, amused that he, a vampire, was haunted, and he felt that the world had some love in it, maybe, to give him such a joke, even if was nothing but poorly constructed word play. It did not dissuade the image, until after breakfast, a breakfast of hash browns, eggs, and bacon. He enjoyed his cooking. It was pleasant, and the smell made his stomach comfortable, like a big, wet sponge filled just right with water and then squeezed out and splashing around in his stomach. It reminded him of the days when he would sit and draw pictures when he was a boy, as he had fresh squeezed Orange Juice. None of his paintings ever lasted very long, and he had a hard time remembering them all. As you must know, in the underwater world, paintings and drawings get soggy, and the oils or the charcoal would break up, with the paper. He would watch his drops of oils paints float from his painting into the sky. His charcoals would turn into powder and mingle with the water, marring the furniture and oftentimes ruining the dinner, like a smoker.<br><br>

He was contemplating this idea again, gazing out the window as he is prone to do, and there, there, in the distance, he saw it again; this enormous creature, golden and sparkling, shining, glimmering. He started looking up words in the thesauri in order to capture not just one, or a few, of the words that define such refulgent, lustrous, luminous things, but all words to define them, including some that we have ignored: ardent, brilliant, luminescent, dazzling, incandescent, polished, and, yes, shimmering, which has a dual definition, thought the Vampire, as it could define a trembling, and the Vampire was again amazed at the beauty within words, and the wondrous joy of unlocking them. The vampire closed the book, and the Golden, hovering creature then seemed to disappear.<br><br>

The Vampire began to write a poem; but the only underwater-writing pen in the house was lost somewhere, and he began to feel frustrated; as immortal beings tend to be by minor annoyances. The abundance, of course, collects over time and does not, as we might think, become less burdensome, but more so. The ten thousandth time you lose a pen is not just losing a pen but having lost ten thousand pens. "And a pen," as his poem said, "is a lifetime of its own."<br><br>

He gave up on finding the pen, and sat down to play his pipe organ, but it wasn't coming right. So he took a nap; and he dreamed about a poem he had written once, or a short story, he hadn't remembered which, about a world where the bubbles he blew, sometimes, were the whole world. The sky was the inside of a giant invisible sphere, where strands of cotton linked together to make different shapes and stories in the sky every day, instead of just reflections of the world beneath it, moving forward, every day, as if we were running under water.<br><br></td></tr>

Jane just poured me today. I’ve never been full like this before. It’s an incredible feeling-I want to roll my base on the table and make that coiling sound she hates. But I won’t. I’m so giddy! What next? I wonder when she will drink me! I’ve never been drunk from before...She filled me with water.  I can see all around me, I've never been in this room before.  She must care about me, the floor is covered with a soft white fur.  I'll never break if I fall in here.  I'm on the nightstand too, so it's not high off the ground.<br><br>
It might be kinda nice to break, but it is scary too.  I'm glad this room is so safe and soft.

<br><br>

It’s Saturday, and she hasn’t drunk me yet. What is taking so long? In a way it’s nice, because I get to spend so much time out of the cabinet. But I’m getting lonely without my friends. What can I do? I can’t tell her to drink me, but who will if I don’t? What if I get dusty, or staph begins to grow in my water? I couldn’t live with myself if she drank me and my water was bad. That would be terrible!

<br><br>

Jane was in the room all day today. She only took one sip of my water. God! I can’t talk about it. She put me back on her dresser, rather than her nightstand. Her hand was trembling.

<br><br>

Haven’t seen Jane at all today. She didn’t come home last night. I wonder where she is! The window is open, and the wind rustles the curtain picturesquely. I can’t wait until she comes back. If only there were some way to find her.

<br><br>

Things have gotten very strange around here. The breeze from the window has been banging the bedroom door open and shut. I saw things outside the room that I could not understand. First, there was a person who walked by the door. Then I heard Jane talking. I saw the two of them just for a second. Then, there were these noises. They made no sense to me; loud and choking, as if she was trapped in my water. The man yelled a lot, but I couldn’t understand his words. Then, I heard another door shut. For hours after that, there was nothing. I thought that Jane and her person had left. But then I heard this rustling sound. I think it was Jane, but I couldn’t see from the dresser. It must have been Jane. She can’t just leave like that. Especially if some other person was here. I hope he left. He was so awful.

<br><br>

I am frightened. Jane does not come in the bedroom anymore. I don’t think she’s moved much for a while, but I can hear her murmuring and rustling around where she is, past the door. I think she is in the kitchen. I can’t hear what she’s saying. Everything seems different now. The curtains hang limply, and the air presses in on me, so the softness of the room rises in the heat and smothers and spills me. I can hear a humming noise outside. It’s hot, and my water is getting warm and stale. What can I do? I wish I could just see her, and know she’s all right! If she just came in and took me into the kitchen and poured me out I could rest my mind.

<br><br>

The house has gotten very quiet. Even the curtains seem nervously immobile. They twitch occasionally when something soft hits the screen and bounces off. A frozen quality has developed, despite the heat. The buzzing outside has become thick and feverish. Also, there is something strange about the air.

<br><br>

The wind has picked up again, and the curtains pushed a vase off the sill. It crashed on the floor, and then there was nothing but the hum outside. When the curtains were sucked back into the frame, I could see a raw, clean circle where the vase had been, and there was no dust there. And with that wind, a sweet, warm smell like lilacs and honey swarmed into the room. The sun catches the broken glass now, and it shimmers grotesquely. It looks so unnatural. I wonder why, when a piece of glass breaks, does it break in such a chaotic pattern? And I wonder now how I will break, and if I will break, and if anyone will ever come.<br><br>

It’s been so slow I didn’t notice, but the windowsill is getting dusty and grey, and the circle where the vase once was is raw and soft. The house smells terrible, like rotten eggs and old meat. Where is she?

<br><br>

My water is beginning to evaporate in this heat. I know now that Jane is not coming back to drink me. What has happened to her, I don’t know. I can only think, again and again, of that one sip, and her trembling hand, and for a moment we were both doing right by ourselves. I don’t mind that she’s gone so much anymore: I’ve come to understand something about her and about myself.

<br><br>

The water is almost gone, and the wind from the window is getting more hectic every day. The whipping curtains almost reach me now. Everything has turned sour: the air, the dust, and my own last water. It’s a beautiful afternoon, though, and for the first time, something I’ve never seen before through the curtain, the sun is hitting a panel of stained glass in the upper pane of the window. There is no real design to it, but it seems to me to be perfectly green, with all kinds of blues worked randomly into the glass. The thin white curtain is pressing against the glass and fluttering away, sporadically, with the wind, and when it is pressed against the glass I can see the green and blue best. Nothing has changed, but now the whole room is trembling. I am rattling against the dresser, and the green in the window glows drippingly brighter until it’s color seems to explode into the room.

"Don't let Toby in the sock drawer." Toby looked up at Linette with his wise, black eyes. Dad shut the door. Linette turned to Toby, who sat on the edge of the divan.
"Don't worry, Toby." Toby wouldn't.<br><br>



The next day, Dad was not back yet. Linette looked all around her room, under the bed and in the drawers and behind them; she looked in the closet and inside the red hatbox and behind the chair and the storage bench. Then she took all the picture books and the framed pictures on the walls and put them all in the red hatbox. Then she drew the curtains and carefully nailed the edges of the curtains to the edge of the window, leaving dents in the fine, soft wood with the hard heel of her shoe as she tapped the nails in with it. Then, when she was done, she stood in the middle of the room and looked at Toby.
"Well, Toby. Have I forgotten anything?" Toby didnt think she had. Since they were both so clearly satisfied with the security of the room, Linette stepped forward and reached into the storage bench. She lifted Toby out, being careful of his delicate bone structure; and, petting the arch of his knobbled spine, she carried him over to the dresser. Linette laid Toby gently on the hard polished surface and opened the sock drawer.<br><br>

"There you go, Toby. I told you not to worry."<br><br>



The next morning, Linettes's socks had been unfolded and braided in threes.<br><br>


Dad was trying to get Linette's window open, but it wouldnt come. When they had painted the house last year, the paint had gotten into the windowframe and glued the sliding panes shut. Now the subterraneous green laquer made cracking noises as Dad strained and pushed at the ledge and sill, respectively. Finally, Dad walked around to the back porch and sat on a chair, watching the mosquitoes bounce off the screen.<br><br>


Toby wrote Dad a letter, because he was angry. He wrote it like this:<br><Br>
_______________________________<br>
Dear Dad,  <br>                          
Leave me and Linette alone. I like <br>
to braid her socks and you can't   <br>
stop me. She likes it too, so there.<br>
Love,   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            Toby.  <br>  
______________________________<br><br>

He wrote it on a napkin but later it fell into Linette's leftover cereal milk.<br><br>


Dad opened the window when Linette was at the pond with Toby. Dad was disapointed that Toby wasn't there, because he wanted to talk to him. But he did reach over to the sock drawer with a long, mossy stick and pry it open. Several braided socks toppled out.<br><br>


"Good morning, Linette. Good morning, Toby." Dad smiled at them. Toby stared at Dad, suspicion burrowing in his flat forhead. Linette and Alex were playing checkers. Linette ignored Dad.
"Today we are going to move. I will help you pack your things if you like."
"No thank you, Dad. I will pack my own things." Linette packed her things and they all got into the car. Dad drove until they reached the Swamp. Then he stopped.
"Linette, would you get my cigars out of the trunk?" Linette got out of the car and walked around towards the back. Toby stared at dad from the back seat.<br><br>

Linette stopped and looked in at Toby.<br><br>

Dad stepped on the gas pedal and drove away. Linette's shoes sank slightly into the soft mud.<br><br>

Five miles away, Dad stopped at a gas station and left Toby by the wood-pile in the back. Toby stared at the car as Dad drove away.

An ocean thick with lions claws the hull as I try to sleep. Wasted mountain ranges Beneath. Creatures blinded by a lack of things to see. Grandmother fed us marmalade and stale bread, before she was carried off by a sudden gust of wind…


<br><br>
Now my younger brother Jack<br>
reads science fiction <br>
on the deck by starlight, <br>
trying to remember my father's<br> 
lessons on navigation.<br><br>

The radio finally picks up a signal…………………<br><br>
It's just grandma playing her ukulele……………… <br><br>
(A message from heaven)………………………..<br><br>

Flying fish used to wide open skies crash into the sails at night. We're out of matches and canned peaches have never tasted so godly.<br><br>

My brother reminds me of a story and we smile; mother waving goodbye as the current carried her away…my father in mid-sentence jumping overboard at the sight of an albatross.<br><br>

We see land from time to time, but we usually get scared and turn around. There are some places in the middle of the ocean where the water is only waist high. I wouldn't say that we are happy; even a billion stars a night can't smooth out the edges sometimes. I smiled for a month when I finally forgave my father.<br><br>

"Remember when we went to the 24 hour circus in Las Vegas? It was three AM, and they had a lion asleep in a cage on the stage. All the clowns looked tired and angry, and they pulled a curtain in front of the cage and lit it on fire (preparing to make the lion disappear) but before they drew the curtain back the lion roared so loudly, and then we saw that he was on fire, and all the clowns were very surprised. They tried to put out the flames and make it look like it was part of the act."<br><br>

"I was so little and at first I started crying, because of the noise, but then I realized it was like a cartoon so I laughed my head off."<br><br>

Gerald... the most popular member of the family.  Everyone liked him.  He was such a unique personality.  He could do anything he wished.  He proved it, day in and day out.  He offered words of wisdom to friends and strangers alike.  He had not one single enemy. <BR><BR>Some folks called him Priestly - we think he was too smart for his own good.  He mowed the lawn a lot, and he never wore shorts.  His father was bitter (a firefighter).  He hated chocolate and war, and he was afraid of fireworks and supermarkets.  He had 2 arms, because having 2 arms is normal, and also, he worked at an ice cream parlor.<BR><BR> But then, July 27, 1967.  The day Gerald went fishing.  He left with such a smile on his face, eager to catch some walleye.  He took off in his Chevy, and <b>was never seen again</B>.  We've done all we can to locate our dearest son Gerald, but to no avail.  It appears, Gerald may well never return. <BR><BR>He loved fishing and ice cream cones.  <b>The Beatles - Revolver</B> was his favorite album, mostly due to his favorite song, <b>Eleanor Rigby</B>.  He loved the Boston Red Sox and boy did he love that Chevy.  He always said, "The man who lasts longest is the last man standing."  Brilliant irony that only Gerald could give.  We will forever miss Gerald, and pray that he is still alive.  Perhaps he started a new life somewhere.  Perhaps he was in a car accident and developed amnesia.  The fact is, we will never know what happened to our dear son Gerald, but nothing could diminish our love for him.<b>  HEAR YOU ME GERALD. </B><BR><BR>The last known piece of information on Gerald is this journal entry, dated July 27, 1967.  A beautiful poem he wrote, perhaps describing his relationship with his highschool sweetheart Mari(she said goodbye to him with one last loveless kiss, as if made by cold lifeless lips).  <BR><BR>

If it wasn't for her, you know,<br>
none of this would have ever<br>
even mattered: the soul would<br>
have been something I found<br>
in any girls hand, regardless<br>
of whether she had my eyes,<br>
took note of the sparkling of <br>
shattered glass on the side of <br>
the streets, and why it is I have<br>
heard it so many times from her<br>
and still managed never to believe<br>
it, regardless, I lost the only <br>
truly wonderful thing I ever really<br>
had.<br>

gary was an ordinary man who had two bookshelves full of books he'd never read and never expected to read. but destiny had taken it into its feeble head to change his life forever. one of the booksheleves toppled over one day, pinning him to the ground, and for two weeks he had nothing to do but read those books, until a cat burglar broke into his apartment and rescued him, after stealing the television<br><br>

by then it was too late: gary had become addicted. he read ten books a day most days, and soon he had read every book in the apartment, including the instruction manuals for the appliances which he had thrown away years ago in frustration at not being able to work them properly.  soon he found himself frequenting libraries and bookstores instead of his usual wholesome activites.  his football buddies left worried messages for him on the answering machine, and his playboy subscription ran out unnoticed.<br><br>

after two years of this, he was the smartest man alive. he lived a full life, accomplished much and made the world a better place to live in, and in the end, his friends and family were so ashamed that nobody came to the funeral.<br><br></td></tr>

In my long quest to find the Muse's secret cave, I had traveled down many paths. I had cut my way through the thickest vine and tangle, hiked across the greatest deserts, swum across the widest channels, and trekked through the most treacherous mountain passes. After sixty seasons of searching, the only path left which I had not investigated was the one with the spray painted neon green arrows and intermittent signs reading, "This way to the Muse's secret cave."<br><br>

In the end, I was desperate enough to try even this remotest of possibilities. I longed more than anything to receive the Muse's blessing, and I was willing to risk anything to get it. So I prepared myself for the journey, and, having said my goodbyes, set off on my fearful way.<br><br>

Nine weeks later, I was not at all surprised to discover that the path led nowhere of note. Just a dank little den with the rotted corpse of a woman long dead. I delivered this news to the world without much ceremony, and nobody was really shocked, except for a ridiculous young lad of seventeen who claimed to have met the Muse and had tea and biscuits with her that very day. We had to lynch him.<br><br></td></tr>

Carlos sat on the sidewalk with his knees against his chest and his legs clamped tightly together. He stared emptily at the rush of passersby, and silently berated himself, taking hold of both ends of his spirit and twisting one around the other, until he knew that the knot could never be untangled. For today, in time of great need, he had failed once again.<br><br>

He thought of his poor sick mother who received no care save that for which he could provide. He thought of his beautiful horse, Cassandra, whom he would now have to sell, and of how little she would bring, because of the fungus that covered the whole of her body. And he thought, for the thousandth time, of the job interview. He thought of the businessman's looming figure across the desk, and of the mixed fear and rage that had filled him as he struggled to answer the terrible questions.

<u>1.Chocolate</b></u><br>

Two memories from childhood. The first being Mr. Greco, an old man who ran a convenience store and was always kind to me. Who one day caught me shoplifting a fudgesicle from his store. I remember he seemed very disappointed, not angry, and just let me give it back. And how from then on when I went in he smiled politely, but never again asked how I was. <br><br>

The second being the relief I felt when he died, and how I felt so guilty that I never ate another fudgesicle again.<br><br>

<u>2.Cherry</b></u><br>

I was eating a cherry popsicle earlier on the day I was shot. It was a joke pop. It had a joke on the bottom, where you held it.<br><br> When you finished it, underneath all that frozen treat, was the punch line. I didn't really pay attention to either part, but I recall looking at it as it dripped onto my hand. I didn't immediately think of blood.<br><br> But when I was on the ground, the bullet piercing my chest, I remember looking at the splash of red sugar that stained my skin. I drew it to my lips, and imagined that all my blood was sweet and cold, instead of the warm taste of oxides and pennies. The blood seeped through the fabric of my shirt, a spring thaw unfolding snow into liquid.<br><br> I promised this time to pay attention to the punch line. <br><br>

<u>3.Orange Creamsicle</b></u><br>

When the world turned black this is what I began to remember. I had been digging up weeds for a friend of my dads. The sun was not the benevolent God of beaches and suntans, but the sun that beat down upon Egyptian slaves in Old Testament days. The peeling on my shoulders revealed a fresh layer of sensitive flesh, burning pink like a newborn.<br><br>

I finished, exhausted, waiting for my father to pick me up. Spotting her, two years older than myself, coming to me with a wet sponge on a stick that tasted of cream and oranges. I remember how the radioactive, cancerous sun transformed into benevolent rays in her golden hair. The whip crack of the summer heat giving gratitude in the revelations of her tank top<br><br>

<u>4.Raspberry</b></u><br>

The disappointment I always find in tasting raspberries, tart and sour, when I expect the sweet explosion of cherries. Its quite different when its not your own blood. Perhaps I hoped to be killed by a woman who loved me, giving my life a final, sweet burst of cherries it needed to mean anything. Instead, the drips of a paper cut, proceeding rationally into the sour red tape of a messy conclusion. There was no more drama than that.<br><br>

She told me to leave the city. If I wanted to make myself better, she said, I could start by leaving. 
I left. I moved to a new town, and got a new job, and ended up shot by some hysteric that I had never met. <br><br>

<u>5.Fudgesicle</b></u><br>
Mr. Greco met me as I walked into heaven. He was there with Jesus and the first dog I ever owned, who barked enthusiastically and licked my face. I asked Mr Greco why he was there, and he told me he had something for me. <br><br>

"We're all forgiven." said Mr. Greco. <br><br>
"Have a fudge pop." said Jesus. <br><br>

We laughed, and we stopped laughing in mid laugh, like those frozen sitcom laughs. Only this time the frozen sitcom laughter was real, and it was a laughter that lasted for eternity. Stuck there, with the credits rolling over me and Mr Greco and Christ in a giant guffaw, naming every single human being and their relationships in yellow writing with a black shadow. <br><br>

Watching the credits roll, the names go by, Jesus began to tell me that the interpersonal relationship of every single human being is what makes the worlds reality possible. Its a whole network of personalities that make our lives anything at all. Every person I'd ever really interacted with had led me to the exact circumstances of my death. I mean I never really thought of it that way before. <br><br>

<u>5. Secret Mystery Flavor</b></u><br>

Jesus knew, yeah, he knew for sure, but he wouldn't tell me.<br><br> 
"I'll tell you later," he said, "when things stop being interesting."<br><br>

little bobby came skipping across the meadow, giggling and singing and smiling.  naked little bobby boy. he came upon a bee hive.  "BEEEES!!!"" ""BZzzZzz HAHAHAHA!" he exclaimed.  through the tall green grass and flowery sweet-scented field he leaped toward them pouring honey all over his naked doughy body.  "BBbzzzzzzz hehehehehehe".<br><br>
swarming and angry bees.  hundreds and thousands and millions of bees.  with sharp painful pointy stingers.<br><br>
little bobby rolled around in the flowerly peaceful meadow pouring more honey on himself giggling, cackling, doubled over in glee.<br><br>
the swarming bees relentlessly came at bobby from all angles and all openings. in his mouth and his ears, his nose and his eyes.  a merciless onslaught of buzzing and stinging.  so many bees, blocking out the bloated and orange fading afternoon sun.  all little naked bobby boy could do was laugh even louder and smile even bigger.  "BEEEES!! HAHAHAHAH!!!! BZZZZZZZ!!!!"<br><br>

Very little is known about Jim. He was born sometime in 1950 to an unknown couple out of Wyoming (they are believed to be deceased) and was convicted in 1992 for sexual abuse in the 3rd degree with a minor. In jail he trained viciously every day and was released in 2001 after serving nearly 10 years.
Jim has worked various odd jobs throughout his life. He has moved from one place to another to try to support himself. The one thing he has always cashed in on is his lust for fighting. Jim learned many tricks of the trade in prison and stole a car to head out west for the big fight.<br><br>

I remember the condensation around my fingers when I pressed them against the window. Thinking to myself, "I am a fog machine," I laid both hands on the glass. I was eight and a half. I had bangs and spaces where my teeth should have been. I had been speaking for six years. I had a turtle and a box of rocks. I had recently learned my parents' real names and had begun addressing them as such: Marta and Steve. Piles of blocks grew and toppled in my hands. Cookies were hidden and found. Barbies had sex. It was great. Things began and began.<br><br>
This is the part where I start describing a particular afternoon: snowdrifts outside covered with triangular pieces of sun and shade, alarm clocks going off in the afternoon, a few kids beating the crap out of each other outside. At that point in my life I was obsessed with outer space. So was my turtle -- in fact, we'd been discussing a number of theories concerning the "sun": I thought it was an alien compound where faulty explosives were stored, which is why it always looked like it was silently exploding. The turtle, who, incidentally, spoke only what I assumed was Russian, scrawled out a few sketches of what he thought the sun's core looked like.<br><br>

I pointed to one of the drawings, which looked like a frying pan full of very small monsters. "What's that?" I said. He thought about it for a second, tilted his shriveled little head, and said "Glrrrfshlif eck snep."<br><br>

My parents were in the study. Actually, they were "in the study." Together. They were still young then. There was a record player in there with them. It was playing Sly Stone at top volume, which is why they didn't hear the doorbell go "bwong." I stumbled and ran, twisted the doorknob. Some guy. I stared.<br><br>

"What are you gonna be when you're old?" he said. I blinked. His sleeves were much longer than his arms. The shirt he wore looked like it was made out of brown terry cloth. He kept his eyes on my forehead as he pushed his nostrils up with the back of his hand, and sniffled.<br><br>

"Did you make your shirt made out of a towel or something?" I said. He arched his eyebrows. "Yeah. I get colds. Tissues are not a very economical choice. I have rent to pay, you know."<br><br>

I didn't know. I nodded. We both stood there.<br><br>

"I dunno," I said. "I think I'll be from outer space."<br><br>

"WRONG," he barked. The volume of his voice propelled me back a few feet. I fell over. I was scared, I guess. I started to cry.<br><br>

"Stop crying," he said. "The entire inside of your head'll dry up. Do you want that?"<br><br>

I shook my head. I didn't want that, a hollow head. I bit my bottom lip and stopped crying. I stood up.<br><br>

He sighed. "All you get to do when you're in outer space is float around, like a cosmic sheep. You will have no direction. It'll be-- so-- sad. Before you know it you're throwing up piles of galactic crud all over the universe." He shuddered. I nodded, slowly.<br><br>

"Okay," he said. "Now. What are you going to be."
"Umm," I said, a bit more cautiously this time, "I think I'll be a shark."
He closed his eyes and shook his head. "No. NO. That's a terrible idea."<br><br>

"Okay," I said. "I'm gonna be a space shark instead, then. And I'll live in the suburbs of Neptune and my only friends will be the other space sharks, and I won't have to do any homework about geography or America, or any part of America, at all. And I'll have so much cartilage." I was almost out of breath. I stammered, "And you can't tell me what to be, so--" I looked behind me. I wasn't to disturb Marta or Steve when they were In The Study. But this guy was bothering me, and he had more stubble than I'd ever seen. I didn't know what to do.<br><br>

"What?" he said.<br><br>

"Nothing," I replied.<br><br>

"So what's up with the staring?" he said.<br><br>

"I was just wondering if I threw something velcro at your face, if it would stick."<br><br>

"Try," he said.<br><br>

I thought about it. "No."<br><br>

"Why?" he said.<br><br>

"I don't have anything made out of velcro," I said.<br><br>

"Listen," he said. "We have to figure this out before I leave. You CAN'T be a space shark. They always get embroiled in these hideous battles with cosmonauts. If your entire life revolves around conflict, you'll never have time to do some really important things."<br><br>

"Like what?" I said.<br><br>

"Like... reading Kierkegaard. And napping in fields next to eight-lane highways. And writing bad poetry. And absorbing landscapes and conversations and moments. And... sharing a drink with someone when you can't just say you love them because that would make everything horrible."<br><br>

I laughed.<br><br>

"Stop laughing," he said. "Your brains will come out of your nostrils."<br><br>

"That's disgusting," I said.<br><br>

"Aah," he said. "Only because it's true." He paused. "Alright. Not much time. What else did you have in mind?"<br><br>

"I thought, maybe, of operating a crane," I said.<br><br>

"Like, a bird? Or one of those machines?"<br><br>

"I don't know. Either one, I guess."<br><br>

"Hmm. Well, the bird thing might work. But that would involve attempting to distort nature, which is usually a pretty bad scene. The machine thing involves a lot of demolition, but it also involves a lot of construction." He thought about it, scratching the back of his head. "Have you ever thought of being a caterpillar?" he asked.<br><br>

"Nope," I said. "But they are really cool, what with all the sections."<br><br>

"And the POTENTIAL," he said. "Someday you would have to turn into a butterfly," he said.<br><br>

"That's pretty hokey," I said.<br><br>

"Okay. Okay. I mean, you could turn into a moth-- right?"<br><br>

"I think so," I said. "We haven't reached that chapter in Science class yet. But I've seen some fantastic moths."<br><br>

"Yeah, me too," he said. "But there's the Light Bulb factor. You can't live with such a one-track mind. The pleasures moths derive are based on false pretenses."<br><br>

"Jesus," I said. "You're such a pessimist. I mean, I could be a REBEL MOTH. I don't have to hover around bulbs all the time. I could find my own version of light, like in Vegas, even, or in some galaxy somewhere, or in a bolt of lightning. Or I could abandon the light thing altogether and just eat strawberries and mate all day."<br><br>

He stared. He blinked. "You're right. You're right, of course you're right. I don't even know what I'm doing here. I could be growing moth wings and flying toward the sun." He turned around.<br><br>

"Wait," I said. He was walking away. "It's filled with MONSTERS...." I yelled, but he was already gone.<br><br>

I went into my room, picked up the turtle, walked into the kitchen, and made a sandwich. I fed some turkey to the turtle. I felt my shoulderblades.<br><br>

I am walking down the footpath of a busy street when suddenly, a hole forms and I fall into it. I can see the passers-by avoid the hole, where I lie, with a large wound in my head and a very broken leg. I try to call for help, but no-one hears me.

<br><br>I meet my soulmate, who dies five minutes later in my arms.

<br><br>As we drive, the bridge starts swaying, then snaps, throwing our car into the river. I try to get the door open as the car fills with water.

<br><br>The tiny, beautiful fairy has her arms around my neck, her head on my shoulder. I rush inside the house, wondering if there is a fairy doctor in the phone book.

<br><br>Two small children, on a raft out at sea, in the middle of the night.

<br><br>I am swimming out to save you from a very large shark with very large teeth. The waves are breaking over my head, and the water is stinging cold. The shark decides I look like a better meal and starts chewing my leg. I scream, and you hold me to your chest, crying and saying that everything will be okay. I last recall you kissing my forehead as I lose consciousness.

<br><br>My fingers forget how to play the piano.

<br><br>I am trying to kick a hole in the wall to escape the flames, but they are catching me too fast.
<br><br>The faces of all humanity are flashing past me. I stare intently, trying to spot yours.

<br><br>Words seem to have escaped my memory during the night and I cannot speak to anyone. Instead, I try to use a series of shrieks and emphatic gestures to indicate my meaning. This is a rather large problem, as I have found out the world is going to be invaded by a horde of 9-foot-high aliens, with very evil weapons and a taste for still living human flesh.

<br><br>For some reason, I am strapped down to the bed, and the water is just rising above the floor.

<br><br>I am trapped in a Star Wars crusher machine, and the walls are closing in. I try bashing the walls, wedging things across the chamber, shrieking for help. I start sobbing, thinking of all the things I didn't have a chance to try, to see, to do. In despair, I yell "Stop!" The walls silently stop moving.<br><br> </td></tr>

Johnny stole democracy. It was a good time for all. Even for Martha who was a decided communist. He had these plans to use it to his own ends. He said, "When I have democracy at my beck and call, then surely Susanne will want to love me again. She, I believe, is into power. After all she did run off with that wallstreet stock broker chump."
He had asked us to help, but we said we had reports due, which we did. Science reports. Plus Freddy had to complete his metal structure, "the youth in arm’s way."<br><br>

So he went right down to California, where the votes really mattered, and because there was some confusion there because the race was so close. They said, "tough to call" on the newsreports. He went there and held up Mr. Dwight, as he exited his voting booth. He told him to "stick ‘em up! Give me democracy, or you’ll be one more dead in a long line of forgotten martyrs." He said that forgotten martyrs line. The one I told him to use.<br><br>

Mr. Dwight didn’t see any problem with this apparently. He didn’t know what was meant exactly by this term, ‘democracy.’ So he gave Johnny democracy! The alarms were then sounded of course, and the doors all locked automatically. The guard came right up to him and said, "Nobody steals democracy mister. Give that back." Johnny made a run for it! He crashed through the gymnasium window out onto the playground with its cars and shopping malls. He was bleeding quite heavily when he arrived back at our place. "Look guys! I did it. I really did! Do you want to see it?"<br><br>

Some of us did, and some of us did not. For example, Doreen thought that she could use it as a visual for her politics class, while Freddy said, "I have to finish my sculpture. Democracy can wait."
<br><br>
For my part, I didn’t know what democracy was, but I had written so much about it with all the language people had given me that I wanted to see it.<br><br>

Johnny’s ex- girlfriend had heard from the backroom, and rushed up to him. "What’d you steal with it, honey?!" You could tell that she was already thinking of him in that way again. "Did you threaten them with sanctions, or economic fallout?! Did you explain to him the politics of laissez- faire capitalism, and that it was really coming into its own, and what did they need it for anyway?! And what are you going to use it for?! Did you offer them money and comfortable jobs for them and their children and their children’s children?!"<br><br>

"No. I just told them to ‘stick ‘em up!’ and they handed it right over."<br><br>

"Think of what you can do with it!" Johnny’s girlfriend was quite excited. She went on, "I agree that socialism is a better form of government, but it just doesn’t offer the kind of power and control democracy offers. This is fantastic!"<br><br>

I asked if he was going to give it to the people that offered the highest ransom.<br><br>

"I don’t think so right yet. I think I’ll hold onto it for awhile and see what good it can do me." He smiled lovingly at his girlfriend. She was a pretty girl. All- American. She wore a cheerleader’s outfit and shopped at certain stores and ate certain foods. She was pretty. A round face, a few freckles, long brown hair in a pony- tail, things like that. The kind of good- looking girl you’d steal democracy for.<br><br>

The cops soon arrived. They had these see- through shields, and they were threatening to throw in tear gas if we didn’t come out with our hands up. They had these funny gruff voices, and stood real upright. And they looked off into the distance like heroes that after having waded through knee-deep mud watching in the night tracer rounds in the distance, they felt that they had served the greatest country on Earth and that they were heroes and valiantly and wonderfully and they’d release the dogs if they had to and bravely and strongly and courageously and of a spirit that allows them to face danger. They saluted each other vigorously.<br><br>

Johnny told them however to leave him be. "How dare you come here! You have been granted no permission. Remember that I am your- Remember that I have democracy now! I am your leader. Don’t talk back, Sergeant Henner."<br><br>

They all sort of stared at the ground then.<br><br>

"Now leave me be!" Johnny said in a revenge tragedy voice. "Leave me be God damn it!"<br><br>

The police got back in their cars and left.<br><br>

Over the next few weeks Johnny began to change a bit...<br><br>

In the third week of Johnny’s "Rule for the People" he called it, he killed Freddy. I was in the kitchen when it happened. I was making Johnny’s favorite steak dinner. Potatoes. Butter. Steak. There was some crashing and tumbling about in Freddy’s room. Some yelling: "Ahhh!" "Bastard!" "Eeegh." "Arggh!"<br><br>

I ran over and opened Freddy’s door.<br><br>

"You spend too much time on this damn statue!" Johnny was yelling furiously, like he was really angry. "The dishes have not been done by you in over three weeks! The dog has not been walked by you, and because you insist on putting him on his run, our backyard is unwalkable due to the level of poop out there!"<br><br>

Which wasn’t true really, but I shouldn’t say anymore.<br><br>

Freddy was laughing, and laughing, and holding his stomach from the laughing. He said things like, "Sorry your highness", and, "I’ll get to it soon Captain!"<br><br>

Then Johnny had Joey come in and shoot Freddy in the head! It was messy and really clouded up his latest painting. It was one of his worst pieces yet.<br><br>

Johnny looked about the room, and then at the doorway. He stared at us in a way to say, "You might be next" so we went back to what we were doing. Helen was watching the television, and I went back to making dinner, and Greg drank Coca- Cola: Nothing Beats The Real Thing!<br><br>

After that we all lived happily ever after. We went to town a lot and ordered expensive drinks. We got into all the best clubs, and went home with all the best women! Johnny’s girlfriend ended up marrying him, even though she was just in love with his democracy (she loved the concept of democracy she told Johnny. It was the mathematics of it. She enjoyed seeing the process) and truly loved Freddy who was killed, if you’ll remember from the narrative. But anyway, they ended up having a boy and a girl, and they bought a house and it was nice. Nice for everybody.<br><br></td></tr>

Light had traveled a thousands years to amass in puddles lining the highways, sent scattered by their tires. Infinity was meaningless, ungraspable, useless to consider. The windows were open, and the crisp air, its scent stained with mist, washed through the car and mingled with their skin. There was no meaning that concerned them. There was no God. There was no death. There were only the yellow lines of a highway rushing towards them; their headlights forming two enormous balls of light speeding into the rising sun. 
<br>
The music was usually reserved for beach parties. It was bouncy, sweet, with constant positive affirmations in its refrains, always with exclamation points: "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!" The sun was coming up. The first shadow draped across his eyes as he pulled down the visor. He reached to turn down the music. She looked at him. She put the visor back up.<br>

"We are driving directly into the flaming heart of Christ!" she said, giggling, "And you want to protect your eyes?"<br>

"They'll be waking up now." He said. "They're probably trying to wake you up. You know, wondering why you haven't got up for school yet."
<br>
She turned up the radio.<br>

"Oh!" she screamed. "I brought something." <br>

She opened a green duffel bag, polyester with white cloth handles, which she had thrown into the back seat. The zipper opened, revealed a tangled mess of plastic sunglasses. Zebra stripes, Leopard spots, bright pink, checkerboard. Donning a pair of black and white checkerboard frames, she grabbed another pair, pink with enormous lenses, and put them over his ears. She smiled but did not laugh. He went to turn down the radio again, to talk. <br>

She slapped his hand, and began to sing. <br>

"Heeeey, raaaah, seeeeee saaaaaaw..."<br><br>


<img src="http://www.notarobot.com/p22.jpg"/><br><br>

"You sip coffee like a professional." He said. "Like a big shot, professional coffee sipper." <br>

"Do you the think the waitresses will call the police?"<br>

"Should I slap your hand?"
<br>
"Never." She put down the coffee. "I should have got some orange juice."
<br>
"Get some."
<br>
"You can't afford it."
<br>
"That's your concern?"
<br>
"The. Waitress. Hates. Us." She spoke in a democratic fashion, each word receiving equal emphasis. Then, rushing: "She hates us because of our sunglasses."
<br>
He put his hand behind his neck, and scratched. 
<br>
"Maybe you should take them off." he suggested. 
<br>
"She already hates us. And I like them." 
<br>
She threw a jelly packet at him.
<br>
"Now you've done it. She'll call the police for sure now. Two high school kids at ten AM on a Thursday in the goddamned waffle house. With big loud atrocious sunglasses, throwing prepackaged orange marmalade."
<br>
She sipped her coffee, like a big shot professional coffee drinker. She was the strange bird outside his window, and as she drank, he watched her elbow extend from her body as she leaned into the cup. It is a clumsy gesture, but not ridiculous. 

<br>

<br><br>
"Jooooonaaaaas." she said. 
<br>
"Ehhhhh?"
<br>
"Jooooonaaaaas." she repeated, then announced,  full of pride: "I got us lost!" Jonas stirred in the back seat. He rose up from behind the two seats, and she laughed. 
<br>
"You're just a head!" she said. "A portable head."
<br>
"Where's the map?" he asked. 
<br>
"I threw it out the window when you fell asleep." Her eyewear had changed to leopard spots, round lenses. "The. Map. Was. Tossed. I. Got. Us. Lost." She honked the horn for each word. "Don't make that face. The portable head does not come with that face."
<br><br>
She fell asleep on the passenger's side, leaving him to turn on the headlights alone. When he came to stop, her eyelids cracked just enough as not to separate her eyelashes. He happened to be looking at her when they did. 
<br>
"Jooonaas." she whispered, and put her hand on his arm. "You know what we'll have is more than that, don't you?"
<br>
"I know."
<br>
There was a long pause. He was still at the stoplight. 
<br>
"Turn down the music for a second, dear? I want to hear the grasshoppers." 
<br>
He did, and she closed her eyes again. 
The light turned green, then red, then green, then red. He did not know when he would move, until a car came from behind him. The crickets became silent from fear of the new movements. He did not turn up the radio as he crossed the intersection.
<br>

<img src="http://www.notarobot.com/p24.jpg"/>
<br><br>
"Oh my god. Oh my god!" she yelled, throwing her glasses on the dashboard, and pulling on his shirt. 
<br>
"What? Are you car sick?" 
<br>
"Look. Look." She pointed at the radio antennae, a silver streak standing up out of the passenger's side of the hood. He looked at it and saw a small black circle moving on it. 
<br>
"It's a bee..." he said. 
<br>
"It's stuck. It's hurt," she said. 
<br>
He pulled over the car and they got out to look at it. 
<br>
It was sliced in half by the car antennae but was still alive. 
<br>
"We have to save it," she said. 
<br>
"We can't," he said. "It's like, sliced, in half. It won't survive." He looked at her. 
<br>
"Then we have to put it out of its misery."
<br>
"That was always what you were better at," he said. 
<br>
She took the bee gently between her fingers, and maneuvered it off the pole without killing it. She put it on the hood, and it flapped its wings but couldn't fly. 
<br>
She put it on the street and stepped on it, twisting her heel. Then she got back into the car. He waited a little bit before getting in again. 
<br>
"I'm sorry, if you thought that was cold."
<br>
"Don't be," she said.

With the windows down you can carve the air with your hands. Your hand gets molded as you point in the direction of the wind. You can overtake it with a flick of the wrist, but the air maintains its strength. Your hand will slide too far in the extreme direction of your intentions. Not because you are weak, but because you are unprepared. Because you do not know the effort required to penetrate that air. Because any amount of force is an overcompensation. 
<br>
The car had arms hanging out its doors. Hands like surfers on the invisible energy of its momentum. 
<br>
"We could turn back, you know." he said.<br>

She let her hand ride the wind some more. <br>

"No." she said. "We can't." <br>

They slept in the same bed; Janine in an oversized tee shirt and Jonas in his boxers.<br>

She did not object when he wrapped her arm around her stomach and placed his other arm beneath her neck. He could not see her, but she smiled, and she held his hand. They both dreamt of moving yellow lines. She dreamt of the two of them, floating above the lines; he dreamt of her, in the clouds, blowing him a kiss.<br>

She woke up before him. They had shifted overnight to face each other, her head nuzzled beneath his neck. She stayed there for a while, listening to him breathe. She noticed his heart setting the rhythm for his breath, which would slide out like long, sustained bass notes. She began to try to hum to them. When he stirred, she rose from the bed, facing away, and went to the washroom.<br>

He woke up to a ten dollar boom box Janine had shoplifted, blaring "Motel 6" from a Yo La Tengo CD. She was jumping on the bed in her oversized shirt and flashy gray underwear. Her hair moved from side to side as long, blonde windshield wipers. There are times her hair would take on a slow motion quality, and her tee shirt emphasized this: her body was the central sphere upon which all things revolved. When she moved, she was of some other dimension where movement was not movement, but birth to a new kind of stillness. Her hair was pregnant with that stillness.<br>

A knock at the door revealed toast, eggs, and orange juice.<br>

"Eat up, dear. This is our last day on the road." <br>

He squinted. She stopped dancing. They struggled to finish a piece of toast between the two of them. <br>

<br><br>

It was two AM that Thursday that Jonas threw a pebble at her window. Her home was in a quiet suburb- wealthy, quiet. Any drama could occur in the space between houses. Her light went on and she opened the window, throwing down three small bags. Then she turned off the light; and was gone for far too long before she appeared at the door. 
Her parents did not wake, and the car, lights off, drove to the end of the road. Jonas still stopped at the stop sign, turned on their lights, and looked at her. "Are you ready?" he asked her; he wanted her to be and he wanted her not to be. He wanted her to be willing but to be unable. <br>

"I'm ready," she said. <br>

"I'm going to just stop at the convenience store." <br>

"No." she said. She was shivering. "No, we don't stop anywhere until we're out of the state. I'm afraid we'll end up settling for a night out, or something, that we won't go through with this."<br>

"Tell me why we're doing this, then. Maybe then we won't be so worried."<br>

"Because I am afraid of my ability to fit in with a world that doesn't make the sense I want it to make. And because I am in love with the performances that they all go through, and terrified of joining it. Because on some mornings I will sit still, for an hour, and just stare at my leg, and be amazed that I have legs, and amazed that it is a human leg, and because I know that if I don't go away, they will make me forget it, they will make me forget what it is to be temporary." She looked at him. "I'm doing this so that I never forget that vitality is a very necessary thing." <br>

"I'm doing this so I won't be alone if you dissolve." he said.<br>

"Shit, Jonas. That's a terrible reason..."<br>

"I know. But it's impossible to resist a girl who gives you the opportunity to save her."
<br>

<img src="http://www.notarobot.com/p28.jpg"/><br><br>

They had breakfast in a small greasy spoon owned by a man named Frank who liked making conversation with Jonas. They had to wait to be seated, and Janine exited for the restroom. <br>

He had a red beard and large cheeks, like a malevolent Santa Claus. He wore overalls and a blue hat with a white circle depicting the name of an oil company. He had extremely nice teeth, which Janine noted and mentioned to Jonas immediately. 
<br>
"We get a bit of rain here, boy, but not so much this season."     
<br>
"Uh huh."     
<br>
"Pretty lady ya got there." 
<br>
Janine came from the bathroom and a plump waitress told her, "Seat yourself, honey." 
<br>
Jonas tried to join her but the man kept speaking. 
<br>
"Yeah." Jonas replied.
<br>
"I said, Pretty lady ya got there." 
<br>
"Oh, Yeah. Yeah. She sure is." 
<br>
"Yep. We get the rain around here but I'll tell ya, last year that god-damned river got so high we was floatin' in sport boats if we was lucky nuff ta own one. We got one out back, we was lucky. They come in handy, them boats. I had one left over but I tell ya, you want to survive out here come rainy season yo' gonna need 'em." 
<br>
"Yeah well, you know, we're only passing by, you know. In town a few days." 
<br>
"Yeah well, I oughta let ya go, bet you're starvin' yourself for some grub." 
<br>
"Ah, yeah, yeah, I should go, she's gettin' lonely." 
<br>
"Yeah well, can't leave a girl lonely. I just couldn't believe the gad damned rain last season is all, so high we lost a goddamned dog." 
<br>
"A dog? really?"
<br>
"Sure did. Lost my best coonhound, made for some good squirrel pie. Ever eaten squirrel pie? Hell no, you probably think we're a bunch of rednecks, dontcha, eatin' squirrel pie. He was a god damned three legged dog and he hunted squirrel till the day he died in that god damned rain storm." 
<br>
"Wow, wow."
<br>
"Wow, yeah, what the fuck are ya boy, some kind of mute?" he said, laughing.<br>

"Ha, ha." he said. "No, no sir." <br>

"Yeah well, go on ahead then, have some breakfast with that pretty girl of yours." <br>

"That man had a three legged squirrel dog that died in a flood." he whispered to her. <br>

She squealed and covered her mouth. Somehow or other the spoon jumped from her soup. 
<br>
"Not so professional today." said Jonas, but when Janine turned she saw a boy from the booth beside them was offering her his napkin. She took it, gratefully, and kissed the boy on the cheek as a thank you. He stared as she cleaned her chin. Then he runs away.
<br>
As Janine and Jonas left the restaurant, Janine changed out of her fifties waitress glasses and into some super sleek green ones. 
<br>
"Race car!" she yelled. <br>

"Race car!" he yelled back. <br>

"Race cars are totally awesome," she said. "I'm going to marry a race car driver." <br>

"I can drive stick." he told her. <br>

"I hope that boy in the restaurant dies."<br>

"That's not very nice."<br>

"Yes it is. I know what's going to happen to him. He's going to die anyway, he's going to grow up and stick his dick in some 16-year-old and have a kid when he's still in high school. And I bet you he hits her."<br>

"His mom?"
<br>
"No. His girlfriend. I bet his dad hits his mother and he will hit his girlfriend."<br>

"That's kind of mean, to wish he would die."<br>

"No it's not. It's kind." she paused. "Everything here is a fucking bee on a radio antennae, Jonas. Don't you notice it anymore?"
<br>
"Not just here." 
<br>
"No, not just here." she said. Her face was blank now.<br>

"Why are we here then? Why not somewhere else?"<br>

"There are bees everywhere. And what can't fly drowns." 
She turned up the radio, singing along. <br>

"Tell me our plan, Jonas. I want to hear our plan again."<br> 

"Okay. We get to the Mississippi. We take some kind of tour, or boat ride."<br>

"Uh huh." she rolled a window down, her hands carving the air once again. She could not sing in key, and so she sang loudly. "So long, so loooong."<br>

"We get dinner somewhere, you said you wanted a pancake or waffle house. So probably, you know, a pancake, or, like, a waffle house." <br>

"Okay." she says. "I know the rest." <br>    

They listened to the song for a while. She kept singing, but from beneath the eyeglasses he saw some kind of moisture build up and release itself onto her cheek. <br>

"And then we are going to shoot each other."<br>


<img src="http://www.notarobot.com/p29.jpg"/><br><br>

They climbed green, metal stairs that left hollow noises from their shoes as they walked it. It was stained with various colors of rust, from streaks of blue to pure oxidized copper. They got on the boat and went to the observation deck on the top floor.<br>

There were scraping noises and a low foghorn. Janine had a cup of coffee, which she held in her hands. She had a vest on, shiny, and was wearing simple black sunglasses. They held hands for a time as the boat moved slowly against the tides. They watched the V formation behind the boat transform the harsh blue surface into a powerless white foam. 
The landscape moved slowly; together, they felt it was a pure kind of stillness that only appeared to move because of how they looked at it. 
Neither Janine nor Jonas felt the need to point; they saw the same things and they did not need to prove it anymore. <br><br>

They held hands until the ship docked. <br>

Loud, hollow steps took them back onto the pier. <br>

They got lobster sandwiches. <br>

"There's a thermal spa," she said. "And a diamond mine."<br> 

"Do you want to go?"<br>

"We can't go inside of the diamond mine." <br>

"Oh." <br>


<img src="http://www.notarobot.com/p2.jpg"/><br><br>

"You don't want any pancakes?" he asked her. <br>

"No." <br>

"They're chocolate chip. With the chocolate chips inside of the pancakes. The way you like them." <br>

"I know." she said. She drank some orange juice. <br>

"We can go home, you know."  He said.<br>

"No."<br>

"Are you sure?"<br>

"No."<br>

"I mean, this is pretty, you know. Big."<br>

"Shut up." she said. "Lets not talk about it. You know it's what we have to do. You know what will happen if we don't. We got away before the shit happened, Jonas, before all that bad shit happened. And if I go back now it's the same as death. We're lucky. We'll never know what it's like to lose." <br>

"Maybe we're supposed to know what it's like to lose." <br>

"I don't want it. I don't care what's supposed to happen. Nothing touches me anyway. I'm afraid of touching it. Of my hands touching any more of this. Sometimes there's these things and they're like I see them, and its like something has come down and painted them, and they're perfect, and then it fades back to normal reality again, and that come down, that come down is a bullet. When the colors fade and the light dies, it's a bullet aimed at my chest. Everything beautiful is a bullet."<br>

"Okay." <br>


<img src="http://www.notarobot.com/p4.jpg"/><br><br>

There were two shots fired in room thirty-two at a Great Western in Arkansas. 
<br>
It was a two-bed room. Janine was staring at the ceiling, feeling a burn in her shoulder. There were massive amounts of blood on her shirt, a blue tee shirt with deeper blue patches around the collars. It had a picture of some kind of robot on it. <br>

She stared at the ceiling and realized soon enough that she was not dying. She was hurt badly, but she was not dying. She rose up from the bed, and, looking across the room, saw Jonas with a massive hole in his stomach. There was blood on the mirror and the wooden bureau. The boom box had been speckled. She walked, slowly, over to the other bed, and she put her hands in his hair, and she whispered to him, in his ear.
<br>
There was a banging at the door. Janine grabbed the gun that was next to him, and put it into her mouth. She did not realize the gun would scald her lips, and she nearly dropped it from the pain. Her eyes were tightly closed, and through translucent skin a blue vein rose, gently, from her forehead. She held the gun to her head, and began sobbing uncontrollably.<br> 

She put it to her heart, but she could not fire. There was a reason she had needed him to shoot her.<br>

She is limp as the man in a blue uniform takes her away. <br>


<img src="http://www.notarobot.com/p10.jpg"/><br><br>
 
Months later, she is in her bedroom, and there is light pouring from the window onto her bed, covering her leg. She looks, for a bit, and then she covers it with a wool blanket, dyed pink.<br>

Everyday Purcell takes my hat off and throws it down the hall. It is an Ocean Pacific hat, my pride and joy, I wear it everyday, if I was older it would smell from sweat, but I am still young enough to not exude any odors. Purcell is in sixth grade and I am in fourth, he has nappy hair, he is sneering and mean. I've never said anything to him, we should pass each other silently in the hall, but no, he takes my hat and throws it as far as he can and cackles a bitter cackle. Then I have to run and find my Ocean Pacific hat in someone's spilled apple juice or buried in the dust bunnies it has collected sliding along the linoleum. One evening there is the annual Rock Rapids skate at the local roller rink. Am I going? Who doesn't go, I ask you. They will play all of the normal songs, Fight For Your Right To Party will be played seven times. I will wear my Ocean Pacific hat. I will have to sit out on the carpeted benches during the slow songs while girls like Courtney W. and Teresa B. get to hold hands with boys like David G. and David B. During a particularly loud Loveshack I find myself next to Purcell. My knees are quaking, he is skating closer and closer with his lips pulling up around his canine teeth. It's as big as a whale, and it's about to set sail. Purcell is wearing a Detroit Red Wings hockey jersey and his hair is slicked back with gel. His eyes are black beads of hatred and destruction, we are coming up on a curve, he puts a hand on my shoulder, and skates right next to me, preparing the other hand for a quick hat grab. Our skate wheels touch once, sending off a little spark. They touch again as Purcell closes in completely, and they screech and send off showers of blue light and then, like some kind of blessed miracle, Purcell's skate buckles under him and he falls into the oncoming traffic of fifth graders shooting the duck and I make the curve safe and sound and the Ocean Pacific hat does not leave my head again for another three years, when I realize that Ocean Pacific is not cool, Skidz are.<br><br></td></tr>

The man was a new addition to the town. It was a touristy town. He thought that he could be of some help if he waved to the tourists and made them feel more pleasant. So he picked a corner, because it was next to the taffy store, and put his red wagon with his belongings between him and the wall, and waited for people to pass by, in order to wave to them. Perhaps the children will grow fond of me, and I can play Santa Claus at the town hall, he thought. It wasn't bad, the waving, but not so good either. Some people would wave, and crack little smiles, but a lot of people wouldn't wave, they would just hold tighter to their children's hands.<br><br>
At night, the lights of the city, in rows on the streets, shined on empty streets but for the man standing on the corner. The turbines, with their terrible sound, ran in the near distance, and on the shore five whales wheezed in great, hollow- cavity heaves, as several workers, and volunteers, worked to dig large- enough holes for them to slide back into the water. In the world there used to be more than these five whales, but then there was not; many of them having collected on beaches like this one.<br><br>

In the daytime, the man dressed in blue slacks and a blue t- shirt. He waved, and when he wasn't waving his hand was on the small of his back. He was on the corner of the main street, and a small road that ran to the ocean. Next to him children watched the taffy wrap itself around the big silver stretching machine; they pointed and pulled at their mother's arms.<br><br>

He dreamed of falling in love again. He thought that perhaps his love would be walking to work, and that she would see him and say, "I feel the same way as you feel. I will call you after work. I see that you understand because you used to work as well, and that you would also call later in order not to be late for work." He dreamed, but he was too old now to be of any use. All the women were married. Many younger women passed him, but they thought, "He is too old for my love."<br><br>

He was married once, and his wife worked with him at the factory. She poured the liquid wax into the seagull molds made in another factory in some unknown place, and then when they were cooled, she clacked them out of the molds, and placed them on the conveyor belt. At another end of the line he painted the beaks. <br><br>
His beaks though, began to chip, and people complained and he was fired.<br><br>

His wife said things like, "We'll be fine. Perhaps there are jobs down at the turbines." When there weren't any jobs down at the turbines, or on the whale watching ships, or even on the pirate ships, things changed. His wife said things like, "I can see that you miss the job, and that you understand that I can not call in late, or call in personal leave to spend the day holding hands, and sitting on red and white checkered- tablecloths, with a wicker basket, out of which we would trade each other bites of filets. You would do the same thing, if you still had the job, or a job." Her tone changed more accusatory, and soon she was going on dates with the milkman, and spending long hours at work or at the laundromat, with her knees on both sides of the milkman's torso.<br><br>

Eventually, even the arguments were a solace for the man, or when they played percussion in the town marching band. But now he waved to passersby on the corner of the main street, and a brick layered street that served as a ramp for the tourists' speedboats in metallic blues and maroons. He fingered the trigger of his gun when there were no passersby. At other times, he wheeled his red wagon down the brick layered side street, between the buildings showing pottery or naval history in their windows, to the beach where he would stop, and sit, and take out of the wagon a red and white checkered- tablecloth, and a wicker picnic basket, and eat the extra fish the harvesters threw him when he stood by their boats and watched in interest, and hunger, as they plowed up the days catch from the bottom of the water. Sometimes there were crab legs.<br><br>

For the fourth day, they had been trying to dig the whales back into the water. The man dressed in blue decided he would help. He left his wagon by the jetty and walked up to one of the men who was pointing and shouting.<br><br>

"Over there! Over there! Dig!" <br><br>
"May I help?" the man asked. <br><br>
"Arrgh! Susan you are doing it wrong. Put your back into it!" the pointing man shouted. <br><br>
"Excuse me. Could I be of any help?" <br><br>
"Oh! Yes. Yes you could," the official said, and handed him a shovel. "Dig over there, by the third whale in's dorsal fin. Thanks, that would be great."<br><br>

He began to dig where the official pointed. The sand sloshed about in the hole he was creating. He was bent over the hole, throwing the sand behind him, and since he was an older man, his back began to hurt. To alleviate some of the pain he stopped for a minute and looked into the eyes of the whales as they opened and closed. And then he put his hand on the whales back, his hand looked small against the skin, and he ran his fingers down the length of it.<br><br>

Sometimes he would dig until he cried, and sometimes he wanted to see China on the other end of the hole, that as he tried to dig deeper, water just kept filling up and in. He wanted to see those people in their large round pointed hats, doubled over planting rice. He also wanted to walk in their streets, and see the colorful dragons dance in the square, and light the paper lanterns, and live above a parchment store with his new wife who would wake him with butterfly kisses, and then make sandwiches for work. They would perhaps make paper lanterns in a factory on the other end of town together, and at lunch they would watch the dragons with their shuffling feet dance about the square, dipping and rising and turning. But then the water would wash the walls out of his hole and he would stand up real straight and put his hands to his back.<br><br>

One day on the causeway, there were protesters with signs on sticks that read: "Let them go!" "Whales are humans too!" and, "You're doing it all wrong!" They walked in circles, and chanted songs that sounded good to the man, and that made his digging into a rhythm, which he thought was nice. Sometimes the protesters would run down the beach and pull his shovel out of his hands and yell at him threateningly. They said that the whales deserved to be set free. That they were humans too. That they could feel like us, and that when they saw each other in the ocean, they saw each other as human beings.<br><br>

The man said, "I am trying to dig a big enough hole for them to swim back into the water."<br><br>

"You are only digging a grave," the protester who was a younger man said to him."I know you're only doing your job," the man said, "but I am trying to help."<br><br>

The protester pointed to where he had been digging, by the dorsal fin. "How is this going to help?"<br><br>

The man noticed that while he was digging in certain areas, others had been digging in other areas, and what they were doing was lowering the whales into the ground. "But the water is filling up, and keeping her wet."<br><br>

The protester said then, "The tide is going out though, the tide is going out!" And then the police came and sprayed him and he cried out and they took him away, but first made him give back the man's shovel.<br><br>

The man became confused. He figured that if he kept digging though, the water would fill the hole, or at least he would get to China.<br><br>

And he dug and he dug, even when the officials, and the crew, and the volunteers all put their shovels on their shoulders, and said that there was nothing left to do.
"There is nothing left to do tonight. Get some rest and come back bright and early," they said to each other as they walked up the beach.<br><br>

His back burned with fire but he kept digging, seeing dragons in the town- square, and the parchment shop.
"Wrap it up old man. We're heading out."
But he kept digging, and digging, and the water kept filling the hole up. He dug all night, even after the big halogens dimmed off and he was in darkness but for the moon and the stars, and alone but for the heaving of the whales all about him, and the hum of the turbines.<br><br>

In the morning, when the workers came back, and after they had put their lunches on the jetty, they began to dig in the specified areas. One man saw where the man dressed all in blue was, and called the others over. Things were said such as, "I don't believe it," and "Would you look at that!" They saw dragons, small in the distance tipping and whirling by the light of paper lanterns, before the water rushed in from the tide.

<tr bgcolor="white"><td>From the wall one boy thought it looked like a radio and another thought it looked like a picture of a radio. There were bugs in the sand. They weren't photos. Slowly, the sand began to move but not the bugs. The sand moved slow like the wind was moving it. It still wasn't clear if it is a picture of a radio or a radio. The boys argued a little without leaving the wall. There was no antenna so they couldn't tell, but there were bugs. The radio, or the picture of the radio, turned on. It went in and out of static. The only interruption was the catching an occasional word or soundbite. The radio dial, like the sand, moved slowly until it settled around 88 where it stopped.<br><br>

The bugs continued to move about, unchanged. One boy made the argument that a picture cannot make noise. The other boy disagreed. Slowly the sand began to move again. This time it was covering the radio, or the picture of a radio. It was also covering the sound. Slowly, as the sand moved to cover it, an antenna appeared from the radio, or picture of a radio. As the sand covered the radio the antenna managed to remain above ground. One boy argued it couldn't have been a photo of a radio if it had an antenna. The other boy still didn't believe it.

<tr bgcolor="white"><td>They made God sell serverware. He was sporting, and didn't make a peep about it. It was pretty enough serverware, after all. There were blue glasses with little bubbles in the glass, and pearly grey sushi plates, square with the corners bent up. God put on a tie he liked and pinstriped pants and shaved carefully every morning. He arranged the plates in delicate stacks, and the glasses in rows. He put bowls on stands so the insides showed, and set glasses in backlit shelves so that the light would reveal the bubbles in the glass. He looked so young and fashionable, with crisply trimmed black hair and dusky eyes that were startlingly blue from the front but almost clear, like pale green glass, from the side. No one would recognize him.<br><br>

He sorted hundreds of chopsticks. It was supposed to be a Japanese place, but the owners were really leftist who thought sushi was The Thing These Days. Clean lines, they told him. Japanese food was healthy food and, therefore, required clean lines. He arranged the chopsticks in cups tied together with straight charcoal grey ribbons, and sometimes he set them across the bowls and on the edges of plates, as though someone had left an imaginary salmon sashimi behind to catch an important call about Business.<br><br>

God didn't think he liked the customers. Maybe he just didn't understand them. They wanted to talk to him very much, but not about anything that was important to them, or that they were afraid to tell him. It was a change, maybe. One women angrily demanded whether or not God would sell her a set of green glasses that neither of them had ever seen before, which God knew for a fact didn't even exist. He was very patient though, and he told her the truth. She screamed at him in wordless rage and fled.<br><br>

God didn't really want to sell things to people. Honestly, no one does. He was a bad salesman, too, because he would always tell the people who had their hearts set on the stemware that it broke in dish washing machines, that the bubbles made the glass structures inherently weak, that the square grey plates never fit in dish drainers and that the paint was leaden, and would poison children. Most people who listened to this told him that they wanted to speak to his manager, and he would laugh and tell them that he wasn't sure they did. Then they would sigh, in a way that made it clear that they wanted everyone to know that they didn't deserve to have their patiences tried in this manner, and that they knew much better whether they wanted a manager than God did. God would get the manager then, and the manager would lie to the people and tell them that it was a good buy and then give them a discount. God never made much on commission.<br><br>

God wanted to go, "Pow, Bang, ALAKAZAM!!" and make a million new galaxies explode into the universe. He wanted to infinitely multiply the possibilities available in reality. He wanted seas of jello and a planet made of wax and a talc mountain and seventeen moons that wove amongst each other, creating a protective web around their mother planet. God wanted to create a nitrogen based life form with glassy green skin and teach humans a language based on smells. God wanted to throw up his arms and have the stars run screaming into his hands, God wanted to live inside of a sun, God wanted to watch the atoms form into the minute bacteria that he would coax into violet giraffes through years of careful maneuvering. God wanted everything to be possible and only he could make it possible.<br><br>

God sighed and dusted another backlit blue glass, and turned it until the bubbles hit the light just so, reflecting a pale drizzle on the dim walls. He sat at the stool behind the counter, and the people thought that maybe they almost saw through him, he seemed so faint and thin.<br><br> </td></tr>

and it exploded one night<br>
"I'd die for one more moment"<br>

"and I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend"<br><br>

?<br><br>


a stranger in this town<br><br>

a starry summer night<br><br>

how high can you go?<br><br>

all those times I wished you'd speak to me<br><br>


THERE ARE THINGS I FEEL THAT I WISH I DIDN'T/THERE ARE THINGS I SEE I WISH I WAS BLIND<br><br>




"You're not ready yet", she said,<br>
"you're just beginning to understand..."<br>





staring at the wall with no clue of what to do or who to see<br><br>


The sunlight enters through the window<br>


"You're not ready yet, you're just beginning to understand..."<br><br>



I wish that I could speak<br><br>

they watch you through the clouds<br><br>

bleeding<br><br>


rocks don't speak<br><br>




"You're not ready yet, you're just beginning to understand..."<br><br>

And he finally understood it,<br>


Another dreaming creature<br>
In a world<br>
of sleepers<br><br>




you're still alive<br><br>



"alive against one's will"<br><br>


"what if the rest of the world was hopelessly blinded by fear?"<br><br>


he walks through the narrow cobblestone streets in a haste, hurrying to find something he doesn't even know.<br><br>

when it is snowing outside and love is lost, imagine flying through the air as it slowly freezes into a sheet of ice. but you are a polar bird and you enjoy your life in this frozen sky. like a wisp of cold air, like dying love, this dream will take your heart and unthaw it just long enough to let you feel what it's like to freeze to death.<br><br>
